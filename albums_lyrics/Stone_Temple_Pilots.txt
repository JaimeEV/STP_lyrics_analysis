"Between The Lines"

Lovely disguise
Read between the lines
You rock the magic plane with no abbreviation
Three
Four
You sell what you bought
And there ain't no magic pen
To get back what you lost

I like it when we talk about love
I like it when you talk about love
You always were my favorite drug
Even when we used to take drugs

Even when we used to take
Even when we used to take
Even when we used to take
Even when we used to take

Penguins don't fly
Crocodile Sunday smile
Really love to fish
But don't like superficial people
Shoe store
Heard it all before
From pearly whites to pearly gates
What do we have to argue 'bout?

I like it when we talk about love
I like it when you talk about love
You always were my favorite drug
Even when we used to take drugs

Even when we used to take
Even when we used to take
Even when we used to take
Even when we used to take

Leave me all alone before
Get out the way
Never did what she was told
Get out the way
Seems to play at time of war
Get out the way
Less is big and listens more

Lovely disguise

You rock the magic plane with no abbreviation

"Take A Load Off"

Summer med fly ruled the airways
Mostly superstitious
Now the kings of media
Invent the swine flu visions

Take a load off
Take a load off
Take a load off
Take a load off
Take a load off 
Take a load off

Yeah, it's alright
As we mosey on into the night
Yeah, just set us free
Could our shattered past just set us free?

Give you all those diamonds
Give you more and more
Shattered all those lies I bought
You from the record store

Fleets of underground an artist
Look for benediction
Drive around waste gas and haul
In every green addition

Summer med fly ruled the airways
Mostly superstitious
Now the kings of media
Invent the swine flu visions

Take a load off
Take a load off
Take a load off
Take a load off
Take a load off
Take a load off

Yeah, it's alright
As we mosey on into the night
Yeah, just set us free
Could our shattered past just set us free?

Give you all those diamonds
Give you more and more
Shattered all those lies I bought
You from the record store

Give you all those diamonds
Give you more and more
Shattered all those lies I bought
You from the record 

Shattered all those lies I bought
You from the record

Shattered all those lies I bought
You from the record store

"Huckleberry Crumble"

Less conversation
No moral obligation
To tell me how you feeling tonight, right
Minds over racin'
Visions got me shakin'
Motor station changing your mind
Mind, mind, mind

I see what's at the ending of the rat trap
Lady Jabowakee's eatin' bed bugs
The rabbit dug a hole straight through to China
So where do we go?
And where is the rabbit's hole?

I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm sinking in
I'm moving in
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away

Ol' Tom Turtles
A hustler and a cousin
His lizard like complexion ain't right
Motor city's moving
The big grizzler's groovin'
He's a number one percenter tonight

Right on
Right on
Right on
Right on

I see what's at the ending of the rat trap
Lady Jabowakee's eatin' bed bugs
The rabbit dug a hole straight through to China
So where do we go?
And where is the rabbit's hole?

I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm sinking in

Don't let the grip on this subside
Chips will only grow one shoulder at a time
The lesson of all lessons of our lives
And forget about the troubles for a time, time, time, time

I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm sinking in
I'm moving in
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away

I see what's at the ending of the rat trap

"Hickory Dichotomy"

Alright alright alright come on
Alright alright alright come on
Alright alright alright come on
Alright alright alright come on

Strange, strange, strange, it's a dichotomy
But it was never quite weird
Or quite normal for me
Take a break, take a breath and let's see where we're at
Those damn bed bugs are sleeping up in my head
All day all night

You telling my story
But you don't know my name
It's a hickory dichotomy
You're messing with my brain

Selling the story
Are you holy or lying
Hickory dichotomy
I tell you the truth then you bite

Alright alright alright come on
Alright alright alright come on

Brave, brave, brave
As the apostles go
Is it a hickory hypothesis
Or one man show?
Take a rest
Or take a travel
In the light of lights
But them tall tale teasers
Keep sneaking in my show tonight
Alright

You telling my story
But you don't know my name
It's a hickory dichotomy
You're messing with my brain

Selling the story
Are you holy or lying
Hickory dichotomy
I tell you the truth then you bite

You telling my story
But you don't know my name
It's a hickory dichotomy
You're messing with my brain

Selling the story
Are you holy or lying
Hickory dichotomy
I tell you the truth then you bite

Alright alright alright come on
Alright alright alright come on
Alright alright alright come on
Alright alright alright come on

"Dare If You Dare"

Oh Mars-1 Juxtapose
Swine flu Sally's
Neon nose grows
Like a life like Pinocchio

Everybody now is just trying to avoid it
Newsman Tom is trying to exploit it
I know a cure to stop the fear and a little rock'n'roll

Primitive minds during primitive times
But Dr. Lady Richard who won a Nobel Prize
With a putridish smile

What to do about third world nutrition
Can we dismantle our stupid vision
And get on with the show?

Dare, dare if you dare
Dare to be something
Dare to be real
Dare, dare to be more
Hope for the better
Dare to believe

It's hard to make amends
When you're sitting there on the fence
Let the proof be in the pudding sugar
Everybody wants to start a new religion
Please relax don't need a soul collison
There's a dusty rose where the promise of love used to be
Yea yea yea

Dare, dare if you dare
Dare to be something
Dare to be real
Dare, dare to be more
Hope for the better
Dare to believe

Dare if you dare
If you dare
If you dare
If you dare

My brother died and brought us together
I hope it lasts and lasts forever
What a hero he turned out to be
I wish he could just believe

Dare, dare if you dare
Dare to be something
Dare to be real
Dare, dare to be more
Hope for the better
Dare to believe

Dare if you dare
If you dare
If you dare
If you dare

"Cinnamon"

When you broke down 
Down

Yeah, come on come on now 
Yeah, come on come on now 
Yeah, come on come on now 
Yeah, come on come on

"Hazy Daze"

I'm freely standing
On my own
Or am I falling
In a river cold?
Those friends always ask me
Saying "How you been?"
Well I've seen somber days

Am I mistaken?
Could you be sitting there lonely too?

He was a man
Who didn't want me anymore
He never
Never
Never 'round
How much did you get for selling out my name?
Still won't forget those hazy days
Yeah

It's in the nighttime
When I'm feeling old
Am I lonely?
I watched you go
My friends always wonder
Ask "How you been?"
Well I've seen better days

Am I mistaken?
Am I mistaken?
Could you be sitting there lonely too?

He was a man
Who didn't want me anymore
He never
Never
Never 'round
How much did you get for selling out my name?
Still won't forget those hazy days
Yeah

He was a man
Who didn't want me anymore
He never
Never
Never 'round
How much did you get for selling out my name?
Still won't forget those hazy days
Yeah

"Bagman"

Bagman honey 
Bagman sugar 
Bagman honey 
Bagman sugar 

I know it feels good 
But be careful with your vices 
Falling 
Crawling on your knees again 
Watch out for the bagman 

Bagman honey 
It'll drive us insane 
Bagman sugar 
Oh do what you want 
Fat man shouting 
You're holding on for nothing baby 
Bagman sleazy 
Does it hurt? 

We almost got it right 
Revelation 
Conversation made it laden 
With the bagman's bag 

Bagman honey 
It'll drive us insane 
Bagman sugar 
Oh do what you want 
Fat man shouting 
You're holding on for nothing baby 
Bagman sleazy 
Does it hurt? 

Then 
There was a dream 
When you said we would be free 
But now is the time 
To be real 

Bagman honey 
Bagman sugar 
Fat man shouting 
Bagman sleazy 

Bagman honey 
It'll drive us insane 
Bagman sugar 
Oh do what you want 
Fat man shouting 
You're holding on for nothing baby 
Bagman sleazy

"Peacoat"

You love me more ? 
Cause you can't imagine me as someone old 
But in the moment of sinless embrace 
Your eyes stare right through me to the back of my face 

I sleep all day 
You're the cause of pain 
We're always good on the road 
Now you were my favorite show 
As long as buses were rolling along 
The destination's unknown 

Talks of our connection was the way it began 
Necessary dope but it was straight obsession 
Couldn't sleep it out, but now who needs sleep? 
Now it was 6 months later, it was, 
Well, you know 

I sleep all day 
You're the price I paid 
We're always good on the road 
Now you were my favorite show 
As long as buses were rolling along 
The destination's unknown

"Fast As I Can"

She don't even like you anymore
She don't even like you anymore
Ain't no chance she loves you like before
She will even take you to the morgue

Gotta gotta gotta now find a way
Gotta gotta gotta now find a way
Gotta gotta gotta now find a way
Now pick up the song there's some to say
Now wait
Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait

I don't know
I'm feeling oh so low
I'm feeling oh so high
Why why why am I crying?
Running fast to the liquor store
I quickly hit the wall
And stumble through the open door
Through the open door

I can't get all them couples anymore
I can't buy you fancy yogurt anymore
When to it comes to me and you
It's all just business like before
And I walk a mile and a half for you no more
No
No

Gotta gotta gotta now find a way
Gotta gotta gotta now find a way
Gotta gotta gotta now find a way
Now pick up the song there's some to say
Now wait
Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait

I don't know
I'm feeling oh so low
I'm feeling oh so high
Why why why am I crying?
Running fast to the liquor store
I quickly hit the wall
And stumble through the open door
Through the open door

Up on the wall I saw an alley cat
She had heels six feet tall and she towered over all
I learned my lesson well
I think we learned our lesson well
Maybe more
Maybe more
Maybe more
Maybe more
Maybe more

I don't know
I'm feeling oh so low
I'm feeling oh so high
Why why why am I crying?
Running fast to the liquor store
I quickly hit the wall
And stumble through the open door
Through the open door

"First Kiss On Mars"

Take a risk and listen to the radio
Click your heels at the bi-polar disco
Fly down the villa destination sign
Everybody feels the days but waits for summer nights

Boy meets girl
They might drive in modern love

Can we really find 
Love, the magic place we dream of
Super magic robots set the 
Solar system free

Reel over, reel over and over
Reel over, reel over 

Take a risk and listen to the radio
Click your heels at the bi-polar disco
Fly down the villa destination sign
Everybody feels the days but waits for summer nights

Boy meets girl
They might drive in modern love

Can we really find 
Love, the magic place we dream of
Super magic robots set the 
Solar system free

Reel over, reel over and over
Reel over, reel over and over

Reel over, reel over and over
Reel over, over and over again

"Maver"

Maver with her lucky bonnet
She used to paint her flowers on it
She keeps her memories on a turnstile
'Cause she's superstitious
She thought she'd be famous
And tell me if I'm wrong
But I think she still just likes to play them
Yeah and maybe you'll be lucky enough
To hear her sing on Sunday
Oh Maver

Maver and her bonnet
Streaks of life upon it
Betting on the ponies
So things could get easier
Just praying on a easy peace for her
Oh Maver

She was a true blue blooded traveler
She left her home post for the West Coast
With a guitar and a bar of soap for 'ol San Francisco
And a fool hearted head of hope
Well she landed in a flat
With some fellas that were lucky to meet her
'Cause she could play the six-string better than
Those macho pendejos
Oh Maver

Maver and her bonnet
Streaks of life upon it
Betting on the ponies
So things could get easier
Just praying on a easy peace for her

How many nights did you make it without it?
Oh
How many lines on your face have paved your way in stone?
Oh

How many nights did you make it without it?
Oh
How many lines on your face have paved your way in stone?
Oh

Maver and her bonnet
Streaks of life upon it
Betting on the ponies
So things could get easier
Just praying on a easy peace for her
Just praying on a easy peace for her
Oh Maver
Oh Maver
Oh Maver

"Samba Nova"

Hard time is never long enough
To keep my head afloat
And my feet are stuck in the mud again
I'm getting old and my money's been spent
Tryin' hard was never good enough
I've got a lot to learn
And she's walkin' right out the door again
I'm torn in two and I don't see the end

You can always buy a new lie
When yours is finally over
Either way you'll find a new life
When yours is finally over

Don't think I ever changed at all, my dear
And you'll see when I'm right
And here's when I'm wrong, but still
I kick myself in the face once again
Sometimes I think that I can kill the world
If just for a day
But I'd just be stuck with myself again
And I don't think I wanna be my only friend

You can always buy a new lie
When yours is finally over
Either way you'll find a new life
When yours is finally over

"About A Fool"

Someone standing alone on a hill
I think you're sinking, can't swim or sit still
Still he's waiting there alone
He's drowning on his own

The fool, who fell in love, left his heart right in the sink
She tore it all to pieces when he left it there
The fool, who fell in love, let his heart wash down the drain
She threw away the pieces when he left it there

Talkin' to myself
Fallin' from the shelf

Still I wonder why I ever let myself, take my own advice
Still I wonder why I ever let myself, take my own advice

Still he's waiting, a man on a hill
I think he's drifting, to float on the wind
Must be a fool to think he could
Bring him back to her

A fool, who fell in love, left his heart right in the sink
She tore it all to pieces when he left it there
A fool, who fell in love, let his heart wash down the drain
She threw away the pieces when he left it there

Talkin' to myself
Fallin' from the shelf

Still I wonder why I ever let myself, take my own advice
Still I wonder why I ever let myself, take my own advice
