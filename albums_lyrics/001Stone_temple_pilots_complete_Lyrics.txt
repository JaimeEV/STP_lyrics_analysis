You wouldn't want me have to hurt you too, hurt you too?

I ain't, I ain't, I ain't
A buyin' into your apathy
I'm gonna learn ya my philosophy
You wanna know about atrocity, atrocity?

I know you want what's on my mind
I know you like what's on my mind
I know it eats you up inside

Can you see like a child?
Can you see what I want?
I wanna run through your wicked garden
Heard that's the place to find you
Cause I'm alive
So alive now
I know the darkness blinds you

Can you see without eyes?
Can you speak without lies?
I wanna drink from you naked fountain
I can drown your sorrows
I'm gonna burn
Burn you to life now
Out of the chains that bind you

Can you see just like a child?
Can you see just what I want?
Can I bring you back to life?
Are you scared of life?

Burn, burn, burn
Burn your wicked garden down
Burn, burn, burn
Burn your wicked garden to the ground

Can you feel pain inside?
Can you love?
Can you cry?
I wanna run through your wicked garden
Heard that's the place to find you
But I'm alive
So alive now
Out of the dark that blinds you

Can you see just like a child?
Can you see just what I want?
Can I bring you back to life?
Are you scared of life?

Burn, burn, burn
Burn your wicked garden down
Burn, burn, burn
Burn your wicked garden to the ground

Holywater clouds my thinking
Sinking low now
Keep on drinking

Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me strong
Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me strong

You control me, soul you stole, mine
Wishful thinking
Six feet under

Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me strong
Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me strong

Dead by dreaming, sleep you steal, mine
Pools of cold sweat
Hatred burns me

Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me strong
Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me strong

Still shackled to the shadow
Still shackled to the shadow
That followed you...
Still shackled to the shadow
Still shackled to the shadow
That followed you...
Still shackled to the shadow
Still shackled to the shadow
That followed you...

You're the fuel to the fire
You're the weapons of war
You're the irony of justice
And the father of law

I've been waiting for awhile to meet you
For the chance to shake your hand
To give you thanks for all the suffering you command
And when all is over and we return to dust
Who will be my judge and which one do I trust

You're the champion of sorrow
You're the love and the pain
You're the fighter of evil
Yet you're one in the same

I've been waiting for awhile to meet you
For the chance to shake your hand
To give you thanks for all the suffering you command
And when all is over and we return to dust
Who will be my judge and which one do I trust?

Forward yesterday
Makes me wanna stay
What they said was real
Makes me wanna steal
Livin' under house
Guess I'm livin', I'm a mouse
All's I gots is time
Got no meaning, just a rhyme

Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal, I like to steal

I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
Well, I'm half the man I used to be, half the man I used to be

Feelin' uninspired
Think I'll start a fire
Everybody run
Bobby's got a gun
Think you're kinda neat
Then she tells me I'm a creep
Friends don't mean a thing
Guess I'll leave it up to me

Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
Guess I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal, I like to steal

I'm half the man I used to be

I broke the breadline
Nobody knows
I walked the frontline
Still got far to go

I mixed the water
I drank the water
I broke the breadline
Don't wanna know

It's staring me down
Wearing a crown of apathy
I'm standing around
Dressed like a clown
Don't know my name
You know where to find me

I killed the manchild
I'll fast alone
I had the midwife
Naked and alone

I mixed the water
I drank the water
I killed the brainchild
I'll fast alone

It's staring me down
Wearing a crown of apathy
I'm standing around
Dressed like a clown
Don't know my name

So where ya going 'til tomorrow?
And I see that these are lies to come
So would you even care?

And I feel it

Where ya going for tomorrow?
Where ya going with the mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel
When the dogs begin to smell her

Would you even care?

And I feel it
And she feels it

Where ya going for tomorrow?

Hey everybody, where did Mary go?
Where did Mary go?
And where's my only cigarette?
Please think for me, I can't bare to

Wet myself, wet my bed
I've readied it all for her, you know
Clean sheets, incense, a lots of fluffy pillows
Now soiled
And where's my cigarette?
Did you check the bathroom, the bathtub?
She sleeps there sometimes
Water cleanses, you know
Washes dirt away, makes new
Maybe she, maybe she, maybe she, maybe, maybe she swam away

Kickin' as I'm tryin' to sleep
I got the mud beaneath my shoes
Rubber band, rubberband
Gun in hand, gun in hand

Yeah, I could hide in the calm of the eye of the storm
And never blow away
Well, I'm a young man with a knife to my back
Some things never seem to change

Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
Sing the song or keep it inside
Bought the farm, but the farmer done died
Sing that song, sing that song inside

I wish I could live in the dream
that I fly on the tarred & freathered wings
Well, I'm losing a game of reality
dice where the dealer never ever pays

Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
Sing the song or keep it inside
Bought the farm, but the farmer done died
Sing that song, sing that song inside

I wanna be as big as a mountain
I wanna fly as high as the sun
I wanna know what the rent's like in heaven
I wanna know where the river goes

Yeah, I could hide in the calm of the eye of the storm
And never blow away

Sing the song or keep it inside
Bought the farm, but the farmer done died
Sing that song, sing that song inside

I wanna be as big as a mountain
I wanna fly as high as the sun
I wanna know what the rent's like in heaven
I wanna know where the river...
I wanna be as big as a mountain
I wanna fly as high as the sun
I wanna know what the rent's like in heaven
I wanna know where the river goes
Where the river goes
Where the river goes
Where the river, yeah
Where the river
Where the river
Where the river
Where the river
Where the river goes
Where the river goes

Longing is the animal inside you when you bleed
Suffering is critical in finding what you need
Deliverance is evidence there’s more than what you say
Pain is there the moment that you wake up from your dreams

Oh, I know you can’t tithe
Oh, when you look inside yourself
You’ve got to cross that line
Yeah, you’re running out of time

Loneliness is beautiful, it leads you home again
Happiness is overrated, joy is infinite
Liberate the hate you feel before it’s permanent
Smile when it hurts, it works like mother’s medicine

Oh, I know you can’t tithe
Oh, when you look inside yourself
you’ve got to cross that line
Yeah, you’re running out of time

You’ve got to learn your lesson to see what you’ve been missing
You’ve got to cross that line

Yeah, you’ve got to look inside
Yeah, it’s time that you decide
Yeah, you’ve got to cross that line
Yeah, you’re running out of time

Black heart's comin', he’s a cold machine
Cuts like a knife, gentle and clean
Face like an angel, mind of a killer
Nobody else gonna love her better

Lay down now stay down
Took her life with a quick pull trigger

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Well I don’t mind, I don’t mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Said I don’t mind if you don’t mind

The color is all but faded
Out of a dead man's eyes
Down to his blackened heart

Black heart's kickin' like a beating drum
Shooting her down the sound of his gun
No compassion, hard as an assassin
Falling deeper still in that reckless fashion

Lay down now stay down
Deeper and deeper with a blind man's passion

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Well I don’t mind, I don’t mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Said I don’t mind if you don’t mind

The color is all but faded
Out of a dead mans eyes
Down to his blackened heart

Rescue me
(If you don’t mind)
[x3]

If you don't mind
The color is all but faded
Out of a dead man's eyes
Down to his blackened heart
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Sending out a message to the world
But I just can't seem to find the words
No one wants to die alone
Broken and insane
Question every last decision
Another empty page

Do you know the answers?
Tell me, I find my happy ending
When do we start pretending that
We're all the same on the inside

Wanting what I know won't satisfy
Just to live this, need to live a lie
Never meant to run away
Jumping out the train
My cage was built on good intentions
Running every page

Do you know the answers?
Tell me, I find my happy ending
When do we start pretending that
We're all the same on the inside

All the same on the inside
All the same on the inside

Do you want the answers?
Tell me, I find my happy ending
When do we start pretending that
We're all the same on the inside

All the same on the inside
We're all the same on the inside
We're all the same on the inside

Yeah, we're all the same on the inside

Forgive the promise that is never kept
The wasted life that you have left
So sell your soul and put it on display
Echoing the debts that can’t be paid

Breathe in let go
The undertow

Will pull you in and throw you out of time
the shadow’s playing tricks on your broken mind

Tears will not cure the pain

Cry cry, can’t say no
Nothing cures a craving
Yeah yeah
Cry cry it’s all a show
Just a game you’re playing
Yeah yeah yeah

Yesterday is lost again
Collect the hours suffering in vein
So hold on tight watch the embers glow
The ashes fly away out of your control

Breath in let go
The undertow

Will pull you in and throw you out of time
the shadow’s playing tricks on your broken mind

Tears will not cure the pain

Cry cry, can’t say no
Nothing cures a craving
Yeah yeah
Cry cry it’s all a show
Just a game you’re playing
Yeah yeah yeah

Cry cry, can’t say no
Nothing cures a craving
Yeah yeah
Cry cry it’s all a show
Just a game you’re playing
Yeah yeah

Cry cry, can’t say no
Nothing cures a craving
Yeah yeah
Cry cry it’s all a show
Just a game you’re playing
Yeah yeah

These endless days are wait for me
Tearing my heart that breaks for you
I'm coming home tomorrow

Though you're not lying next to me
I hear your song that calls to me
I'm coming home tomorrow
Back in your arms

Tomorrow's just a dream I can't detain
It's like a fall I can't contain
And though it seems so far away
It's just a day, a lonely day away

The summer's gone and I can see
The season's end is set me free
I'm coming home tomorrow
Back in your arms

Tomorrow's just a dream I can't detain
It's like a fall I can't contain
And though it seems so far away
It's just a day,
A lonely day away

Tomorrow I'm coming home
Tomorrow I'm coming home
I'm so tired and so alone

It's like a dream I can't detain
It's like a fall I can't contain
And though it seems so far away
It's just a day,
A lonely day away

You can get it if you really want it
But you better off just leave it alone
You won't forget it if you ever had it
So you're better off just stayin' at home
She walked in with her alligator sister
Trying to get to heaven on Sunday
You'll never get it
If you never had it
So better off just leave it alone

And the dogs came in
Just to see her smile
Just to see her smile

You don't get it, no, you won't forget
So you're better off just leave it alone
If you don't stop thinkin'
Soon you will be drinkin'
And you're better off just stayin' at home

And the dogs came in
Just to see her smile
And the gods came in
Just to see her smile
Just to see her smile

Coming down
Mom I'm still healin'
Coming down
Oh, and I'm still breathing
Coming down

Falling downward with a flaming hand
I knew the questions but I lost the answers
I'll hold the world for all
I'll hold it for all
As long as no one asks no questions

I got the message
And the message stood
One, two, three
I got another, got another
One, two, three
I got another, got another
I got another hit that held me the last time
Don't ya know what I mean boys?
One, two, three
I got another, got another

Falling fast but doing all I can
I know the questions but I lost the answers
I got the message and the message stood
Lease the one who makes it
Profit from the riddle
Kill the one that breaks it
Always in the middle
Keep the dream alive
With sleeping pills you shouldn't fiddle
Lease the one that makes it
Profit from the riddle
I got the message but I lost the answers
I got the message but I lost the answers

And I don't believe it
Is she really gone again?
And I don't believe it
Is she really gone again?

I'll find a way to you someday
I'll find a way to you someday

Father's always smoking
And your mom's at church on Tuesday
And your brother's always drinking and dyin'

And I don't believe it
Is she really gone again?

She turned away, what was she looking at?
She was a sour girl the day that she met me
Hey! What are you looking at?
She was a happy girl the day that she left me
She turned away what was she looking at?
She was a sour girl the day that she met me
Hey! What are you looking at?
She was a happy girl when she left me

What would you do?
What would you do if I followed you?
What would you do if I follow?

Don't turn away, what are you looking at?
He was so happy on the day that he met her
Say, what are you looking at?
I was a superman, but looks are deceiving

The rollercoaster rides a lonely one
I paid a ransom note to stop it from steaming
Hey! What are you looking at?
She was a teenage girl when she met me

What would you do?
What would you do if I followed you?
What would you do if I follow?

The girl got reasons, they all got reasons

Hey! What are you looking at?
She was a happy girl the day that she left me
The day that she left me
She was a happy girl the day that she left me
She was a sour girl the day that she met
The day that she left me

I'm going under, I'm suffocating
Drowning but I'm holding on
What keeps me breathing? Don't have an answer
I'm drowning but I won't let go

Away now, no way out
Away now, no way out

I've been a walkin' a lonesome highway
I felt as though I had no home
My bed's been taken by another I made the bed, now lie alone

Keep it away now motherfucker, now keep it away
Keep it away now motherfucker, now keep it away

Away now, no way out
Away now, no way out

I used to love you now I don't care
Now I turn around, you're everywhere
So you can chew me up and spit me out
You're just a little bitch I cared about

I know you can see me
But you don't believe me
I know that you're lonely
Time will tell and time is hell

No sex or violence
No morbid silence
Forever sleeping
You won't stop breathing

You hold me captive and it's not fair
Progressed insanity is everywhere
You need to love me but you kicked me out
My head is wandering so knock me out
I keep my head afloat I'm drownin' in
The muddy water pulls me down again
I used to love me but I hate me now
I'm just a little bitch I cared about

Torment the tortured, teach me things
I'm so alive
Speak to the speechless, seek the things
You have inside
You can hunt for the hunter
He's got nowhere to hide
You can seek with the seeker
But hold on for the ride

Keep it coming I'm going all the way
Keep it coming I'm going all the way

Just give me half a chance
From throwing it all away
Run to the place that hides the pain
You have inside
Cover my chain it hides the strain
Only to glide
You can hunt for the hunter
He's got nowhere to hide
You can seek with the seeker
But hold on for the ride
There's nowhere to turn, nowhere to run
You can fly with the fader, fly it. Fly it on the run

It's too late, the time is gone
Later on again 'cause no one's leaving
Look away

I got you
But it's the craving for the good life
That sees me through trouble times
When my mind begins to wander to the spoon

And I got you
Because you're there to bend and nurture me through these
Troubled times
'Cause the fix begins to twist my troubled mind

And I got you to paint the sorry on my day
And I got you to paint the roses on my grave
And I got you

I got you
But it's the feeling that I get when you're away
Twist my mind 'cause when I'm alone and cold, I fell like dyin'
And I got you to fill the craving that I get inside my mind
When you're there to fill the space I have inside, I feel like cryin'

And I got you to paint the sorrow on my day
And I got you to paint the roses on my grave
And I got you

All the slippin' that I slap me
I got you, I got you
All the slippin' that I slap me

No you don't get
No you don't want it
No you don't get it, no

No you don't get
No you don't want it
No you don't get it, no

She don't like the way she smiles
He don't like the way she smiles
Son of a bitch
I know what the itch is like
You won't get enough
She don't like the way she smiles
(Don't want you)
He don't like the way she smiles
(Don't need you)
She don't like the way she smiles
(Can't have you)
He don't like the way she smiles
(I want)

No you don't get it
You'll never get it
No you don't get it
I want to see through you

No you don't get it
You'll never get it
No you don't get it
I want to see through you, Now!

She lives in a bungalow
She kills me with rosegarden thorns
She waits for me
My love is unusual
It's painted with roses and thorns
with her I'm complete

She lives by the wall
and waits by the door
She walks in the sun
to me

Visions of Mexico seduce me
It goes to my head so carefully
Memories of candles and incense
And all of these things remember these

She lives by the wall
and waits by the door
She walks in the sun
to me

She comforts me when
the candles blow out
the cake has grown mold
but the memories are sweet
The laughter's all gone
but the memories are mine
The Mexican princess
is out of my life

She lives by the wall
and waits by the door
She walks in the sun
to me

Fare thee well so long
Hate to say goodbye to you
I can tell you're gone
By the way I'm missing you
Don't you realize you're everything to me?

Got my heart out in my hand and don't you know it?
Something deep inside's come over me
I'm gonna sacrifice my soul just to show it
Can you try to tell me what it means?

Could this be love? Love?
Coming over me
Coming over me
Could this be love?

When you're gone, I found
A part of me is there with you
Are you still all mine?
I hope you're telling me the truth
'Cause the saddest thing's when love goes away

Got my heart out in my hand and don't you know it?
Something deep inside's come over me
I'm gonna sacrifice my soul just to show it
Can you try to tell me what it means?

Could this be love? Love?
Coming over me
Coming over me
Could this be love?
Fare thee well

Got my heart out in my hand and don't you know it?
Something deep inside's come over me
I'm gonna sacrifice my soul just to show it
Can you try to tell me what it means?

Could this be love? Love?
Coming over me
Coming over me
Could this be love?

Fare thee well so long
Hate to say goodbye to you
I can tell you're gone
By the way I'm missing you
Don't you realize you're everything to me?
Don't you realize you're everything to me?

Still in the morning sun
It was Saturday, if I don't mistake
And all that we've become
Turned to lullabies of love and heartache

It brings the rain
I hear your name
I wish you were ready
Ready for someone
When all is done
It's why you run
'Cause you were not ready
Ready for someone

Once and twice begun
These three wishes I cannot replace
And what would they become?
Turn to lullabies of love and heartache

It brings the rain
I hear your name
I wish you were ready
Ready for someone
When all is done
It's why you run
But you were not ready
Ready for someone

There's not much more left I can do or say
Your silence is telling the truth 'cause you walked away
'Cause you walked away

It brings the rain
I hear your name
I wish you were ready
Ready for someone
When all is done
It's why you run
But you were not ready
Ready for someone

Thank you for the memories I'll carry
But time is said to move along
Never been one to do things gracefully
I know, for that, I'm always wrong

Oh, perdida, come and go
Stay with me tonight
But in the morning, please be gone

I know the changes are the ones you seek
I'm lost in circles most the time
As stronger reason gets the best of me
Behind the smile, I'm slowly dying

Oh, perdida, come and go
Stay with me tonight
But in the morning, please be gone
And oh, perdida visits me
I'll meet you in the sky
Where the winds turn into breeze

Oh, perdida, come and go
Stay with me tonight
But in the morning, please be gone
And oh, perdida visits me
I'll meet you in the sky
Where the winds turn into breeze

You dream in color
But stare at cracks in the wall
You're in cloudy season
Always another
Another room down the hall
You grow tired of leaving

I wish I may, I wish I might
It won't be long now, we could spend the time
What do you wish for when you close your eyes?
And a tear tells me
You've never been good at goodbye

Do you remember
When you would take on the world?
But it's cloudy season
And stormy weather
Has been here for too long
You're so tired of leaving

I wish I may, I wish I might
It won't be long now, we could spend the time
What do you wish for when you close your eyes?
And a tear tells me
You've never been good at goodbye

I wish I may, I wish I might
It won't be long now, we could spend the time
What do you wish for when you close your eyes?
And a tear tells me
You've never been good at goodbye

All alone, the years go by
Now they're gone I wonder why
We lived a lifetime only to say goodbye

Once there was a time when love was new
Remember when we said "I do"?
And now you've gone away
The years remember those days

Now we're here and after all
Who's to blame for what we lost?
Years have cracked through me with nowhere to hide
'Cause they know

Once there was a time when love was new
Remember when we said "I do"?
And now you've gone away
The years remember those days

She's my Queen
She came from the northern sky and found me
She painted bright stars all around me
She's my soul, a melody, she's my Queen
She's my Queen
And just like a dream I could see her
She was meant for me and now I need her
She's my soul, a melody, she's my Queen

If I could count the ways (Oh yeah)
If I could count the ways I would (Oh yeah)
If I could count the ways (Oh yeah)
If I could count the ways I would (Oh yeah)

She's my Queen
And it took so long for me to find her
I want to spend my days here beside her
She's my soul, a melody, she's my Queen

If I could count the ways (Oh yeah)
If I could count the ways I would (Oh yeah)
If I could count the ways (Oh yeah)
If I could count the ways I would (Oh yeah)

She's my Queen
She came from the northern sky and found me
She painted bright stars all around me
She's my soul, a melody, she's my Queen

If I could count the ways (Oh yeah)
If I could count the ways I would (Oh yeah)
If I could count the ways (Oh yeah)
If I could count the ways I would (Oh yeah)

If time could rewind, that's the first thing I'd do
Now I bathe in the sound of echoes of you
I'd canvas the sea just to know what you knew
Wanna feel everything you've ever been through

You're so far from me I can honestly say
I'm longing for you, not just memories of you miles away

If I could stop time, that's the last thing I'd do
Just to savor the essence of echoes of you
Your absence so loud I could still see your face
These walls rearranging with each step I take

'Cause you're so far from me I can honestly say
I'm longing for you, not just memories of you miles away

If time could rewind, that's the first thing I'd do
Now I bathe in the essence of echoes of you
I would canvas the sea just to know what you knew
I wanna feel everything that you've ever been through

'Cause you're so far from me I can honestly say
I'm longing for you, not just memories of you miles away

I'm longing for you, not just memories of you miles away
I'm longing for you, not just memories of you miles away
I'm longing for you, not just memories of you miles away
I'm longing for you, not just memories of you miles away

We don't need to love for all we know
We could just pretend that everyone is made of snow
So please forgive me if I seem out of line
Seal it with a kiss before you go

We're the lucky ones for all we know
We could find a reason but the reasons never show
So please forgive me if I seem out of line
Here's another kiss before you go

You found yourself while losing your heart
I hope that's all that you request
You found yourself while losing your heart
We can always reminisce
Tears become lies when they try to resist
And we can't deny that it's turned into this

Life has just begun for all we know
Find another reason to begin out on our own
So please forgive me if I seem out of line
And here's a final kiss before you go

You found yourself while losing your heart
I hope it's all that you request
You found yourself while losing your heart
We can always reminisce
Tears become lies when they try to resist
And we can't deny that it's turned into this

You found yourself while losing your heart
I hope it's all that you request
You found yourself while losing your heart
We can always reminisce
Tears become lies when they try to resist
And we can't deny that it's turned into this

A sunburst comes, a sunburst goes
Leaving behind more than anyone knows
Glimmer of light for a flower to grow
If you could stay for a moment what would we say?

A sunburst came, a sunburst gone
You can't be anywhere for too long
Yet you find everywhere to belong
If you could stay for a moment what would you even say?

Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
(I know, I know, I know)

A sunburst comes, a sunburst goes
Leaving behind more than anyone knows
Glimmer of light for a flower to grow
If you could stay for a moment what would we say?

Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again

Fine place for a day full of breakdowns
Takes more than a meltdown to show us how
Throw a tack on the road, stop the meatplow
Got a bullet but it ain't mine

They got these pictures of everything
To break us down, yeah to break me down
They make us hate and we make it bleed

But I got a lover and yeah she shows me how
To understand it, yeah to understand
I got a brother and well he show me how
To make amends, yeah to make amends with it

Take a break from the mousetrap we call home
Takes more than a message to make me smile
I can feel when she kisses me sleeping
But not when the news is on

They got these pictures of everything
To break us down, yeah to break me down
They make us hate and we make it bleed

But I got a lover and yeah she shows me how
To understand it, yeah to understand
I got a brother and well he show me how
To make amends, yeah to make amends with it

They got these pictures of everything
To break us down, yeah to break me down
They make us hate and we make it bleed

But I got a lover and yeah she shows me how
To understand it, yeah to understand
I got a brother and well he show me how
To make amends, yeah to make amends with it

One time a thing occurred to me
What's real, and what's for sale?
Blew a kiss and tried to take it home

Isn't you, isn't me
Search for things that you can't see
Going blind, out of reach
Somewhere in the Vasoline

Two times and it has rendered me
Punch drunk and without bail
Think I'd be safer all alone

Flies in the Vasoline we are
Sometimes it blows my mind
Keep getting stuck here all the time

Isn't you, isn't me
Search for things that you can't see
Going blind, out of reach
Somewhere in the Vasoline

You'll see the look and you'll see the lies
You'll eat the lies, and you will.

Flies in the Vasoline we are
Sometimes it blows my mind
Keep getting stuck here all the time

It isn't you, isn't me
Search for things that you can't see
Going blind, out of reach
Somewhere in the Vasoline.

it's ok, it's ok, ok relieve me
pins in me, pins in me, in me you kill me
the lounge fly
the lounge fly
the fly you bring me
I think I'm free but the dogs they
won't release me

I can't give what I take away
and the other understands
she said she'd be my woman
she said she'd be my man
I can't live this way
please refill my soul

don't have a nickel or a dollar but
you feed me
my bottle's empty but you always
refuel me
I feel I'm sinking but you won't
let me drown me
I wanna fuck, wanna fuck
but do you need me?

Waiting on a Sunday afternoon
For what I've read between the lines
Your lies
Feeling like a hand in rusted chains
So do you laugh at those who cry?
Reply

Leaving on a Southern train
Only yesterday you lied
Promises of what I seemed to be
Only watched the time go by
All of these things you said to me

Breathing is the hardest thing to do
With all I've said and all that's dead for you
You lied
Goodbye

Leaving on a Southern train
Only yesterday you lied
Promises of what I seemed to be
Only watched the time go by
All of these things I said to you

our bed we live, our bed we sleep
making love and I become you
flesh is warm with naked feet
stabbing thorns and you become me
oh, I'd beg for you. Oh, you know I'll beg for you.

pick a song and sing a yellow nectarine
take a bath, I'll drink the water that you leave
if you should die before me
ask if you can bring a friend
pick a flower, hold your breath
and drift away...

she holds my hand we share a laugh,
slipping orange blossom breezes
love is still and sweat remains
a cherished gift unselfish feeling...
oh, I'd beg for you. Oh, you know I'll beg for you.

pick a song and sing a yellow nectarine

if you should die before me

she tells me things, I listen well
drink the wine and save the water
skin is smooth, I steal a glance
dragon flies "er" gliding over...
oh, I'll beg for you. Oh, you know I'll beg for you.

have you seen your mother girl?
has she gone away?
gone away and found the pearl
but the price she paid
gone
when you wake in the morning
gone
when you find that there's no one sleeping
gone
pretty penny was her name
she was loved and we all will miss her

how far will you go I say,
just to bait a mouse?
shorter lived and longer gone,
can you figure out?

have you lost your sister girl?
she's all but blown away
blown away and lost the pearl
and the price she paid

find you in the dark
read you like a cheap surprise
without shame
sell me out, and frame your name

I can hear when the pig whispers sweetly
jealousy is the weapon you kill me
keep a dime for a truth you might tell
you toed the line, and I know it was mine
couldn't hide, write a wave, ride a lie
let me know, can I friend ask you why?

rolling back the days
with my friend I love to play
the "little one"
superman with silver gun

I can hear when the pig whispers sweetly
jealousy is the weapon you kill me
keep a dime for a truth you might tell

wait for me, take a dive take a piece of my life
(leave me numb)
wait for me, tell a lie, try to take my life
(leave me numb)
wait for me, take a dive take a piece of my life
(leave me numb)
close to me, and I'll leave you numb

Drivin' faster in my car
Falling farther from just what we are
Smoke a cigarette and lie some more
These conversations kill
Falling faster in my car

Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to take a ride
It leaves today no conversation
Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to wait too long
To wait too long
To wait too long

Too much walkin', shoes worn thin
Too much trippin' and my soul's worn thin
Time to catch a ride
It leaves today, her name is what it means
Too much walkin', shoe's worn thin

Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to take a ride
It leaves today no conversation
Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to wait too long
To wait too long
To wait too long

Conversations kill
Conversations kill
Conversations kill

Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to take a ride
It leaves today no conversation
Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to wait too long
To wait too long
To wait too long

Conversations kill
Conversations kill
Conversations kill

moderation is masterbation
what is what, and what makes you feel good
all these things I think about,
I think about
always come unglued

yeah, I got this thing
it's comin' over me, I got thing
it's comin' over me, I got this feelin'
coming over me, yeah

this confusion is my illusion
nowhere to look, but know where
to find ya.
all these things I'm sick about,
I'm sick about
always come unglued

you don't look but you kick me
you can't feel but you hit me
you can't live with the way I pray

why we all have to look this way
I gotta heart, I got blood, feel pain

time, time is not on my side
cause the way I am
gotta gotta now gotta find the reason why
a woman ain't a man

you don't look but you kick me
you can't feel but you hit me
you can't deal with the way I pray

why do you all have to think this way
I gotta heart, I got blood, feel pain

fall in those single file lines
like army ants
yeah, fall on into those single file lines
and complete the plan

somebody told me, I know where to go
somebody showed me, I was last to know

sell me down the river
sell me down the river
sell me down the river
sell me down the river

what I wanted, is what I wanted
what I wanted is what she wanted

unfriendly feelings, down on wounded knee
unfriendly reasons, some blind mother's need

sell me down the river
sell me down the river
sell me down the river
sell me down the river

what I wanted, is what I wanted
what I wanted is what she wanted

you read the words and it sells you life
they sell their words, but it's all a lie

Playing on your stereo
Dining and dancing too
Entertain on the piano

The second album
12 gracious melodies
To listen

Keeping you company

Well
Getting on the record soon
Grooving on an afternoon

This album cover
Looks similar like Johnny Mathis
For Mathis lovers this album has his style
Beautiful numbers are heard on the car radio
After all records are cut in the recording studio

My second album
One dozen melodies
To listen
Include this number
Keeping in company

Well
Hoping that this record sells
Singing by a wishing well
That's on my album too

Loud talk, dumb love, lacerator
Come and touch
Bleed to feel, feel to f**k
Keep ya comin', comin' back for more

Alcohol, it's a lie, stimulate a needle in your eye
Let it bleed, blow your mind
Touched myself, nearly went blind

Couldn't find a way to live though the pain
Couldn't find a way
Dumb love
Couldn't find another way to win the race
Couldn't find a way
Dumb love

Couldn't get outta bed
Ten ton bricks layin' on my head
Persecute the crucified
Kill a man for losing his mind

Couldn't find a way to live through the shame
Couldn't find a way
Dumb love
Couldn't find another way to win the race
Couldn't find a way
Dumb love

Come on out, you're comin' home
Deceive yourself, you're all alone 
Come on out, you're comin' home
Deceive yourself, your secret's known

Loud talk, dumb love, lacerator
Come and touch
Bleed to feel, feel to f**k
Keep ya comin', comin' back for more

Alcohol, it's a lie, stimulate a needle in your eye
Let it bleed, blow your mind
Touched myself, nearly went blind

Couldn't find a way to live though the pain
Couldn't find a way
Dumb love
Couldn't find another way to win the race
Couldn't find a way
Dumb love

Couldn't get outta bed
Ten ton bricks layin' on my head
Persecute the crucified
Kill a man for losing his mind

Couldn't find a way to live through the shame
Couldn't find a way
Dumb love
Couldn't find another way to win the race
Couldn't find a way
Dumb love

Come on out, you're comin' home
Deceive yourself, you're all alone 
Come on out, you're comin' home
Deceive yourself, your secret's known

Monday, back from the dead 
I'm letting it go, back for another one
Tuesday, shoot me in the head 
I'm takin' it back, takin' it back 
It'll take it back

Wednesday, she's looking for a friend
She'll get what she wants 
Can't seem to get enough
Thursday, it's more than I can stand 
I'm holding her down, holding her down 
She's down again 

I've gotta find a way to find her 
Where could she be?
Four days of the week she thinks I'm the enemy 

One day, left me for the dead 
Woke up on the floor, time for another one
Two days, she's leavin' me again, can't take it no more
Out through the open door 

Three days, she's found herself a friend 
She got what she wants 
Still never get enough
Four days, she's back with me again 
She's pullin' me down, pullin' me down 
I'm down again

I've got to find a way to find her
Where she could be?
Four days of the week she thinks I'm the enemy 

Monday's gone
Tuesday's fadin'
Wednesday's gone 
Thursday's all but wasted now

Monday, back from the dead 
I'm letting it go back for another one
Tuesday, shoot me in the head 
I'm taking it back, taking it back 
I'll take it back

I gotta find a way to find her 
Where could she be?
Four days of the week she thinks I'm the enemy 
thinks I'm the enemy

Tar and feathers hide your feelings
If you even know the meaning
Your high road is overrated
You left your guru out there hangin'

Don't stay
Don't stay

Your appetite's insatiable
Devouring one thousand souls
It's more or less the same old story
The princess and the whore. The lady.

Nobody sees it 
Nobody hears it
Nobody breathin' in a coma
So keep your secret
Your perfect secrets
It's just a game but no one's playin'

In a coma lying, waiting
Desire fills the lonely craving
So many trampled-under footwear
But more to fill the trophy cases.

You're on the outside
You're lookin' in
You're takin' pictures of what you never been
So kill to kill 
So ya wanna die?
You're burnin' slowly - with seven lives

Blow up the bitch with the firecracker smile
Switchblade in her suitcase
Loves to drive 'em wild
So kill to kill
Yeah ya gonna die
Everybody's searchin' - every single night

You'll never keep it 'cause you sold yourself
And by the way
You'll never lose it 'cause you never had it
It's all the same

Rock Star Life - turn on the switch
Hollywood Bitch - so fake that she seems real
She goes again

She's from the "Westside" she's lookin' thin
She fills her body with what she'll never be
So kill to kill - so you wanna die?
Everybody's searchin' - every single night

If I were to die this mornin'
Would you tell me things that you wouldn't have?
Would you be my navigator?
Would you take me to a place we could hide?

As I'm fallin' out
I wonder what I lost
Must be movin' on
Know I'll be waitin' here alone

I wanna ask you to forgive me
I haven't been the best with all that I had
Wish I'd only laid beside you
I think I spread myself a little too thin

As I'm fadin' out
I don't feel anything at all
Think I'm movin' on
Know you'll be safe but not alone

You're the everything
That led me to believe,
"Hold on, hold on"
You're the wonder in everything
That's wonderful

When you're fed up and lonely
And nothing else seems to matter really

I'll be here waiting for the 
Black cloud to leave you
I'll be here to hold your hand 
When you're tired and lonely

Hold your breath underwater
And know you'll rise to the
Surface slowly

Think of me as a ship that might hold you

Carry you to the shore 
When you're tired and lonely

She can't eat 
She can't sleep 
She's not well (she's lonely again)
She can't breathe
She's in bed
She's in hell

But she'll never 
Really be alone 
As long as I'm beside her

Hello, it's late
You know I've tried to stop the rain
Did you read about it?
Did you think about it?
Did you cry but nothing came?

Hello it's late
I know we tried to win the game
Did you hear about it?
Did you dream about it?
I know you cried but nothing changed ?
Nothing matters again
I didn't think it'd last that long
But I'm just sittin' on this merry-go-round,
And the music is too loud

It's just a game
That we used to play
I didn't think we'd 
Take it all the way
It kills me just because 
It can't be erased - 
We're married

There was this girl 
Who lived not too long ago
As a matter of fact I think
She lives still
She knew she could do no wrong
Just singin' those songs
That we all knew

She would always crash the party
It was no surprise
It was for her

Too Cool Queenie

There was this boy
He played in a rock-n-roll band
And he wasn't half-bad,
At saving the world
She said he could do no right
So he took his life
His story is true

It's ok cause what goes around, comes around
It's all right cause what goes around, comes around

And now this girl, 
Yeah she got real famous
And she made lots of money and
Some of his too
But still she thinks she can do no wrong
Just playing those songs 
She's all too cool

Regenerate the impoverished souls
That echo you
Bleed to feed the masses
Soup line two times two

They got your picture from the 
Sunday Plain Dealer that listed you
(Dead)

Forget the story. There's a bounty on 
Your head. They fingered you

Right away. Right away
Green light. Get a move on
Right of way, right of way
Stop sign, put the brakes on

Positive cell regeneration
Positive cell regeneration

Celebrate the immortal youth 
That wasted you
Peel the skin back from all the lies
That blistered you

They hold for ransom 
All the watered down truths
That splintered your
(Faith)
So sell your soul, because you're already
(Dead)
They've listed you

To the fields where lesser mice go
To the fields where men follow
To the fields where lesser mice go
To the fields where we all follow

So I'm letting it go again
I'm halfway full on 
Left my meds on the sink today
My head will be racing by lunchtime

So I'm holding her hand again
My palm sweats
Hold on 
Think I've had too much coffee
I'm manic as hell
But I'm goin' strong
Left my meds on the sink again
My head will be racing by lunchtime

Don't sleep behind the wheel at the stoplight
Can't sleep behind the wheel as you're drivin' home

You keep comin' down the hill as you're fallin'
You keep fallin' from the hill as you're comin' down

Miles above your circumstance
There's water on your mind
I've wrestled with convictions
And I've settled with the tide

It's more or less uncertainty
But still you play the game
A pedicure won't change the score
But all of this will fade

So low, better get on
Everything's stopped (down)
So slow, better get on
Everything's slowed down 

Take a bath with consecrated water 
From the shrine
And wash away the mud of all the
Miles you left behind

Triplicates and wedding rings
Both lethal to obtain
So batten down the credit cards
The devil's in the den

Finally I've met you
The day has come
You're more than beautiful
And you're my son

I don't deserve this
I never thought it could be
Quite like the moment
When you first smiled at me
A toothless, wonderful feeling
Like I'd never seen

It's you, Noah, it's you 
And when you lie down to sleep
I'll protect you
From the demons of the night
While I'm watching you grow

I'll pray
There's so much I could teach you
If you only have the time
Pray
There's so much God can teach you
If you only have the time

So will you tell me the little things?
What does God look like?
And angels' wings?
I don't remember these things
So would you teach them to me?
So for the moment 
I'll watch you breathe

And when you wake up in the morning 
And I pour the coffee
You're always smiling sweetly

Leave me out, get away 
I gotta go
Long way home
Can't see through the trees
Leave me out, get away
Better run fast as I can
From the man - the dirty man - the old man

In my song
Run away, fly away
Long way home
Through the fields, the burning fields
Call my name
When you knock on the door
Go insane
When you knock on the door in my head
And it's beatin' like a drum

Tell me
Is it more of the same and
Where can I find it?
Tell me
Is she fighting for air and
Where does she come from?
Tell me 
Leave me out, get away 
I gotta go
Long way home
Can't see through the trees
Leave me out, get away
Better run fast as I can
From the man - the dirty man - the old man,
Run away when he's knocking on the door
What's she runnin' from? 
I really don't know
Keep her runnin' it's a long way home
I hear the music - songs we know
It's out of time and the beat's too slow

Don't fall in love with the midnight train
'Cuz it'll leave you in the Middle of Nowhere
The criminals have this all contained
That's why you shouldn't come back 'til it's over

The propaganda's oh-so soothin'
But I think you should aim a bit lower
You don't like what I have to say
But there's nothing you can say because
There's nothing you can do about it

'Cuz there's a right way
And there's a wrong way
And then there's my way
You better not forget it

She fell in love with a simple man
But he'll leave you in the Middle of Nowhere
She doesn't want what you're offering
That's why you shouldn't come back 'til you're older

The propaganda's oh-so soothin'
But I think you should aim a bit lower
You don't like what I have to say
But there's nothing you can say because
There's nothing you can do about it

'Cuz there's a right way
And there's a wrong way
And then there's my way
You better not forget it
You better not forget it
You better not forget it
You better not forget it
You better not forget it

Don't fall in love with the midnight train
'Cuz it'll leave you in the Middle of Nowhere
The criminals have this all contained
That's why you shouldn't come back 'til it's over
You better not forget it

The propaganda's oh-so soothin'
But I think you should aim a bit lower
You don't like what I have to say
But there's nothing you can say because
There's nothing you can do about it

'Cuz there's a right way
And there's a wrong way
And then there's my way
You better not forget it
You better not forget it
You better not forget it
You better not forget it
You better not forget it

Spread the news don't you feel much better
The cenacles are afraid to die
What's the truth but an open letter
By the clowns soaked in pesticide

Realize
You're gonna pay the price
You're gonna pay tonight

Some don't but to have is better
I got lost there along the way
I don't care for the change in weather
I let go to come back again
Realize
I'm guilty in my ways

Heard the news and it ain't much better
The innocent try to stay alive
Every time there's a real go getter
Falling down in the well that's dry

Realize
You're gonna pay the price
You're gonna pay tonight

Some don't but to have is better
I got lost there along the way
I don't care for the change in weather
I let go to come back again
Realize
I'm guilty in my ways

Rise and shine, Clementine
There's just something about you
Do you think you could dance
Cause I'm willing to stay fade away
And ride on

Sing a song, make it long
Cause there's nothing without you
All I need is a chance
And I'm willing to play, night or day
And ride on, on and on

And we're all...
Yeah, we're all just killing time and having fun
Here in the sun

When there's nowhere to hide
Yeah we're gonna sip on
As we drink from the fire
That was burning in the meadow
With luck in our eyes
And the stains of our souls
We can drink from the fire
That was burning in the meadow

You'll be mine, Clementine
'Cause I can't live without you
I've got something to say
But you've already made
Made your way, so ride on
When you're gone, here's a song
I'll be thinking about you
I'll remember your ways
And the thrills that you gave, gave away
So ride on, on and on

And we're all...
Yeah, we're all just killing time and having fun
Here in the sun

When there's nowhere to hide
Yeah we're gonna sip on
As we drink from the fire
That was burning in the meadow
With luck in our eyes
And the stains of our souls
We can drink from the fire
That was burning in the meadow

I gave you all you gave another
I hold the wheel, you light the flame

When there's nowhere to hide
Yeah we're gonna sip on
As we drink from the fire
That was burning in the meadow
With luck in our eyes
And the stains of our souls
We can drink from the fire
That was burning in the meadow

Step inside the maiden ride
It helps if you don't breathe
Patronize and criticize
And welcome to the scene

I hope it comes out right
It's just a little lie

Hide behind another crime
The benefit's so sweet
It's alright it's just this time
The purity's unclean

I hope it comes out right
It's just a little lie

It's the only way to go from here
The only way to go from here

Realize just what's inside
We sink before we bleed
Some may run and some may hide
But that's alright with me

I hope it comes out right
It's just a little lie

It's the only way to go from here
The only way to go from here
From here

Wait, come get lost in my reflection
But there's nothing honey to help ease the soul, yeah

There's nobody to carry us now
There's no one when we're out here alone
It's all fighting and violence
Now that we've made it this far on our own

Oh, in the violence now
And it all stays the same
All gets wasted
And it all stays the same
In the violence now

Wait, we've exhausted all direction
There's nowhere to hide when you can't ease the soul, no

There's nobody to carry us now
There's no one when we're out here alone
It's all fighting and violence
Now that we've made it this far on our own

Oh, in the violence now
And it all stays the same
All gets wasted
And it all stays the same
In the violence now

Oh, in the violence now
And it all stays the same
All gets wasted
And it all stays the same
In the violence now

I swim in oceans of blue sky Autumn hazy
They tell me it's only you
Anticipating the one thing that could save me
But something's not right with the moon
Every time I get by I get closer to thinking
And we don't need that again
I've been sinking in blue eyed Autumn baby
Still thinking back to when

I thought she'd be mine
Thought she'd be mine
I thought she'd be mine
Thought she'd be mine
I thought she'd be mine
Mine in the morning

I walk the streets out of time so tired and lonely
Never to be the same
It could've been something beautiful if only
I opened my eyes too late
Every time that I try words get lost in the wind
And we don't need that again
I've been thinking of blue eyed Autumn baby
I used to remember when

I thought she'd be mine
Thought she'd be mine
I thought she'd be mine
Thought she'd be mine
I thought she'd be mine
Mine in the morning

I thought she'd be mine
Thought she'd be mine
I thought she'd be mine
I thought she'd be mine
I thought she'd be mine
Mine in the morning
I thought she'd be mine
Mine in the morning

Mine in the morning
I thought she'd be mine
Mine in the morning
I thought she'd be mine
Mine in the morning

Do you believe in something beautiful
Between chaos and the light
You gave it all for something you once sold
The truth be told you lied

If it's the taste you remember
You may not share in this sweet delight
Yeah we can live forever
If there's a time we can get it right

Roll me under, I'll pull the trigger for ya
Do with me what you will
Hold me under, the water running over
Do with me what you will

Are you receiving nothing once again
Is there shame for what's been done
It screams so loud that you can't begin
'Cuz you're always on the run

If it's the taste you remember
You may not share in this sweet delight
Yeah we can live forever
If there's a time we can get it right

Roll me under, I'll pull the trigger for ya
Do with me what you will
Hold me under, the water running over
Do with me what you will

Roll me under, I'll pull the trigger for ya
Do with me what you will
Hold me under, the water running over
Do with me what you will
Do with me what you will

You're all bark
But no bite
It's alright
You'll live a little
It's okay
You're on fire
You have style
It's just a little wild

What a poor little baby
Ah, such a poor little baby

No, it's never enough
You hide it away
Where no one can touch

Now you tell me
That you can do better
But we both know you can't
'Cause you'll never
Put away your anarchy
'Cause now we both know
That you're no good for me

In the dark
Without light
It's alright
You'll live a little
It's okay
You conspire
With desire
It's just a little wild

What a poor little baby
Ah, such a poor little baby

No, it's never enough
You hide it away
Where no one can touch

Now you tell me
That you can do better
But we both know you can't
'Cause you'll never
Put away your anarchy
'Cause now we both know
That you're no good for me

No, this is never enough
You hide it away
Where no one can touch
It's never enough
It's just never enough
You hide it away
Where no one can touch

Now you tell me
That you can do better
But we both know you can't
'Cause you'll never
Put away your anarchy
'Cause now we both know
That you're no good for me
No good for me

You can drive, you don't even know me
I don't mind, I'll just take the back seat
Close my eyes, 'cause I just need to rest now
I'm so tired, from always running in and out

Get in line, just another repeat
Keep in time, we're moving to the new beat
Close my eyes, 'cause I just need to rest now
I'm so tired, from always running in and out

Of all the places I have gone
And all the faces I have known
They never seem to feel like home
And now it's time for letting go

I hope to see your smile again
But some day's far too long of a road

The art of letting go
I may be setting myself up to have to
Walk the streets alone
For letting go

You can drive, I don't even know me
Take your time, it's only for the lonely
It's in your eyes, and I don't need to rest now
I'm alright, it's never hard to figure out

Find the time, we don't need a repeat
Keep in mind, we're moving to a new beat
A rise in tide, out there is the feeling
I'm so tired, but only when I'm breathing

Of all the places I have gone
And all the faces I have known
They never seem to feel like home
And now it's time for letting go

I hope to see your smile again
But some day's far too long of a road

The art of letting go
I may be setting myself up to have to
Walk the streets alone
For letting go

I hope to see your smile again
But some day's far too long of a road

The art of letting go
I may be setting myself up to have to
Walk the streets alone
For letting go

You never said goodbye
It left a void that's like no other
I know because it's true

A darkness hid inside
Another storm has scorned another
I know because of you

And now
I know the pressure you were under
Behind your eyes there lied a war
I never thought you'd be another
Another thought and I was up
Here in your finest hour
This is your finest hour

I won't forget that smile
It was contagious like no other
I know because it's true

I'll hold our precious time
Up to the sky, I'll miss you brother
I hope you know it's true

And now
I know the pressure you were under
Behind your eyes there lied a war
I never thought you'd be another
Another thought and I was up
Here in your finest hour
This is your finest hour
Here in your finest hour
This is your finest hour

And now
I know the pressure you were under
Behind your eyes there lied a war
I never thought you'd be another
Another thought and I was up
Here in your finest hour
This is your finest hour
Here in your finest hour
This is your finest hour

A new tradition
Go put your good shoes on
what's your position
And where do you belong

Let's break away from these
These ties before we're gone

Repeat transmission
Thought you were nearly on
I dig your revision
Let's play your favorite song

Let's break away from these
These ties that should be gone

I'm going down, down, down
I hope she lets me in
I'm going down, down, down
I hope she lets me in

The first decision
The one that puts you on
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Let's break away my sweet
'Cause soon we will be gone

I'm going down, down, down
I hope she lets me in
I'm going down, down, down
I hope she lets me in

There comes a day when you say
That you're left here all alone
There comes a time when you find
That you're out here all alone

I'm going down, down, down
I hope she lets me in
I'm going down, down, down
I hope she lets me in

I've had no tolerance for days
What's that color that you use
Forever
In my experimental phase
All these colors that turn blue
Together

I'd rather sleep out on the Avenue
Than hold onto those pieces
Of all the things you thought you never knew
You're better off wrong

Midnight afternoon
A window I can't see through
When I'm in my reds & blues

Welcome the monumental haze
All the wonder we once knew
Forever
There's been no sleep for several days
The struggle we went through
Together

I'd rather sleep out on the Avenue
Than hold onto those pieces
Of all the things you thought you never knew
You're better off wrong

And where you lie is where a flower grows
Won't make a sound for the brand new day

Midnight afternoon
A window I can't see through
When I'm in my reds & blues

Lovely disguise
Read between the lines
You rock the magic plane with no abbreviation
Three
Four
You sell what you bought
And there ain't no magic pen
To get back what you lost

I like it when we talk about love
I like it when you talk about love
You always were my favorite drug
Even when we used to take drugs

Even when we used to take
Even when we used to take
Even when we used to take
Even when we used to take

Penguins don't fly
Crocodile Sunday smile
Really love to fish
But don't like superficial people
Shoe store
Heard it all before
From pearly whites to pearly gates
What do we have to argue 'bout?

I like it when we talk about love
I like it when you talk about love
You always were my favorite drug
Even when we used to take drugs

Even when we used to take
Even when we used to take
Even when we used to take
Even when we used to take

Leave me all alone before
Get out the way
Never did what she was told
Get out the way
Seems to play at time of war
Get out the way
Less is big and listens more

Lovely disguise
Read between the lines
You rock the magic plane with no abbreviation
Three
Four
You sell what you bought
And there ain't no magic pen
To get back what you lost

I like it when we talk about love
I like it when you talk about love
You always were my favorite drug
Even when we used to take drugs

Even when we used to take
Used to take
Even when we used to take
Used to take
Take
Even when we used to take
Used to take
Even when we used to take
Take

Summer med fly ruled the airways
Mostly superstitious
Now the kings of media
Invent the swine flu visions

Take a load off
Take a load off
Take a load off
Take a load off
Take a load off 
Take a load off

Yeah, it's alright
As we mosey on into the night
Yeah, just set us free
Could our shattered past just set us free?

Give you all those diamonds
Give you more and more
Shattered all those lies I bought
You from the record store

Fleets of underground an artist
Look for benediction
Drive around waste gas and haul
In every green addition

Summer med fly ruled the airways
Mostly superstitious
Now the kings of media
Invent the swine flu visions

Take a load off
Take a load off
Take a load off

You from the record store

Less conversation
No moral obligation
To tell me how you feeling tonight, right
Minds over racin'
Visions got me shakin'
Motor station changing your mind
Mind, mind, mind

I see what's at the ending of the rat trap
Lady Jabowakee's eatin' bed bugs
The rabbit dug a hole straight through to China
So where do we go?
And where is the rabbit's hole?

I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm sinking in
I'm moving in
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away

Ol' Tom Turtles
A hustler and a cousin
His lizard like complexion ain't right
Motor city's moving
The big grizzler's groovin'
He's a number one percenter tonight

Right on
Right on
Right on
Right on

I see what's at the ending of the rat trap
Lady Jabowakee's eatin' bed bugs
The rabbit dug a hole straight through to China
So where do we go?
And where is the rabbit's hole?

I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm sinking in

Don't let the grip on this subside
Chips will only grow one shoulder at a time
The lesson of all lessons of our lives
And forget about the troubles for a time, time, time, time

I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm sinking in
I'm moving in
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away

I see what's at the ending of the rat trap

Alright alright alright come on
Alright alright alright come on
Alright alright alright come on
Alright alright alright come on

Strange, strange, strange, it's a dichotomy
But it was never quite weird
Or quite normal for me
Take a break, take a breath and let's see where we're at
Those damn bed bugs are sleeping up in my head
All day all night

You telling my story
But you don't know my name
It's a hickory dichotomy
You're messing with my brain

Selling the story
Are you holy or lying
Hickory dichotomy
I tell you the truth then you bite

Alright alright alright come on
Alright alright alright come on

Brave, brave, brave
As the apostles go
Is it a hickory hypothesis
Or one man show?
Take a rest
Or take a travel
In the light of lights
But them tall tale teasers
Keep sneaking in my show tonight
Alright

You telling my story
But you don't know my name
It's a hickory dichotomy
You're messing with my brain

Selling the story
Are you holy or lying
Hickory dichotomy
I tell you the truth then you bite

You telling my story
But you don't know my name
It's a hickory dichotomy
You're messing with my brain

Selling the story
Are you holy or lying
Hickory dichotomy
I tell you the truth then you bite

Alright alright alright come on
Alright alright alright come on
Alright alright alright come on
Alright alright alright come on

Oh Mars-1 Juxtapose
Swine flu Sally's
Neon nose grows
Like a life like Pinocchio

Everybody now is just trying to avoid it
Newsman Tom is trying to exploit it
I know a cure to stop the fear and a little rock'n'roll

Primitive minds during primitive times
But Dr. Lady Richard who won a Nobel Prize
With a putridish smile

What to do about third world nutrition
Can we dismantle our stupid vision
And get on with the show?

Dare, dare if you dare
Dare to be something
Dare to be real
Dare, dare to be more
Hope for the better
Dare to believe

It's hard to make amends
When you're sitting there on the fence
Let the proof be in the pudding sugar
Everybody wants to start a new religion
Please relax don't need a soul collison
There's a dusty rose where the promise of love used to be
Yea yea yea

Dare, dare if you dare
Dare to be something
Dare to be real
Dare, dare to be more
Hope for the better
Dare to believe

Dare if you dare
If you dare
If you dare
If you dare

My brother died and brought us together
I hope it lasts and lasts forever
What a hero he turned out to be
I wish he could just believe

Dare, dare if you dare
Dare to be something
Dare to be real
Dare, dare to be more
Hope for the better
Dare to believe

Dare if you dare
If you dare
If you dare
If you dare

I'd like to sing a story for you 
Here's what I'd sing if I could impress you 
Hear me can you hear me?

You've got to be the prettiest girl 
I've ever witnessed in the whole world 
Hear me can you hear me?

Hear me can you hear me?

Always speak the words so lovely to hear 
Hear me can you hear me?

Seems like you left me 
When you broke down 
Down 
Down 
Down 

Yeah, come on come on now 
Yeah, come on come on now 
Yeah, come on come on now 
Yeah, come on come on

I'm freely standing
On my own
Or am I falling
In a river cold?
Those friends always ask me
Saying "How you been?"
Well I've seen somber days

Am I mistaken?
Could you be sitting there lonely too?

He was a man
Who didn't want me anymore
He never
Never
Never 'round
How much did you get for selling out my name?
Still won't forget those hazy days
Yeah

It's in the nighttime
When I'm feeling old
Am I lonely?
I watched you go
My friends always wonder
Ask "How you been?"
Well I've seen better days

Am I mistaken?
Am I mistaken?
Could you be sitting there lonely too?

He was a man
Who didn't want me anymore
He never
Never
Never 'round
How much did you get for selling out my name?
Still won't forget those hazy days
Yeah

He was a man
Who didn't want me anymore
He never
Never
Never 'round
How much did you get for selling out my name?
Still won't forget those hazy days
Yeah

Bagman honey 
Bagman sugar 
Bagman honey 
Bagman sugar 

I know it feels good 
But be careful with your vices 
Falling 
Crawling on your knees again 
Watch out for the bagman 

Bagman honey 
It'll drive us insane 
Bagman sugar 
Oh do what you want 
Fat man shouting 
You're holding on for nothing baby 
Bagman sleazy 
Does it hurt? 

We almost got it right 
Revelation 
Conversation made it laden 
With the bagman's bag 

Bagman honey 
It'll drive us insane 
Bagman sugar 
Oh do what you want 
Fat man shouting 
You're holding on for nothing baby 
Bagman sleazy 
Does it hurt? 

Then 
There was a dream 
When you said we would be free 
But now is the time 
To be real 

Bagman honey 
Bagman sugar 
Fat man shouting 
Bagman sleazy 

Bagman honey 
It'll drive us insane 
Bagman sugar 
Oh do what you want 
Fat man shouting 
You're holding on for nothing baby 
Bagman sleazy

You love me more ? 
Cause you can't imagine me as someone old 
But in the moment of sinless embrace 
Your eyes stare right through me to the back of my face 

I sleep all day 
You're the cause of pain 
We're always good on the road 
Now you were my favorite show 
As long as buses were rolling along 
The destination's unknown 

Talks of our connection was the way it began 
Necessary dope but it was straight obsession 
Couldn't sleep it out, but now who needs sleep? 
Now it was 6 months later, it was, 
Well, you know 

I sleep all day 
You're the price I paid 
We're always good on the road 
Now you were my favorite show 
As long as buses were rolling along 
The destination's unknown

She don't even like you anymore
She don't even like you anymore
Ain't no chance she loves you like before
She will even take you to the morgue

Gotta gotta gotta now find a way
Gotta gotta gotta now find a way
Gotta gotta gotta now find a way
Now pick up the song there's some to say
Now wait
Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait

I don't know
I'm feeling oh so low
I'm feeling oh so high
Why why why am I crying?
Running fast to the liquor store
I quickly hit the wall
And stumble through the open door
Through the open door

I can't get all them couples anymore
I can't buy you fancy yogurt anymore
When to it comes to me and you
It's all just business like before
And I walk a mile and a half for you no more
No
No

Gotta gotta gotta now find a way
Gotta gotta gotta now find a way
Gotta gotta gotta now find a way
Now pick up the song there's some to say
Now wait
Wait

I don't know
I'm feeling oh so low
I'm feeling oh so high
Why why why am I crying?
Running fast to the liquor store
I quickly hit the wall
And stumble through the open door
Through the open door

Up on the wall I saw an alley cat
She had heels six feet tall and she towered over all
I learned my lesson well
I think we learned our lesson well
Maybe more
Maybe more
Maybe more
Maybe more
Maybe more

I don't know
I'm feeling oh so low
I'm feeling oh so high
Why why why am I crying?
Running fast to the liquor store
I quickly hit the wall
And stumble through the open door
Through the open door

Take a risk and listen to the radio
Click your heels at the bi-polar disco
Fly down the villa destination sign
Everybody feels the days but waits for summer nights

Boy meets girl
They might drive in modern love

Can we really find 
Love, the magic place we dream of
Super magic robots set the 
Solar system free

Reel over, reel over and over
Reel over, reel over 

Take a risk and listen to the radio

Maver with her lucky bonnet
She used to paint her flowers on it
She keeps her memories on a turnstile
'Cause she's superstitious
She thought she'd be famous
And tell me if I'm wrong
But I think she still just likes to play them
Yeah and maybe you'll be lucky enough
To hear her sing on Sunday
Oh Maver

Maver and her bonnet
Streaks of life upon it
Betting on the ponies
So things could get easier
Just praying on a easy peace for her
Oh Maver

She was a true blue blooded traveler
She left her home post for the West Coast
With a guitar and a bar of soap for 'ol San Francisco
And a fool hearted head of hope
Well she landed in a flat
With some fellas that were lucky to meet her
'Cause she could play the six-string better than
Those macho pendejos
Oh Maver

Maver and her bonnet
Streaks of life upon it
Betting on the ponies
So things could get easier
Just praying on a easy peace for her

How many nights did you make it without it?
Oh
How many lines on your face have paved your way in stone?
Oh

How many nights did you make it without it?
Oh
How many lines on your face have paved your way in stone?
Oh

Maver and her bonnet
Streaks of life upon it
Betting on the ponies
So things could get easier
Just praying on a easy peace for her
Just praying on a easy peace for her
Oh Maver
Oh Maver
Oh Maver

Hard time is never long enough
To keep my head afloat
And my feet are stuck in the mud again
I'm getting old and my money's been spent
Tryin' hard was never good enough
I've got a lot to learn
And she's walkin' right out the door again
I'm torn in two and I don't see the end

You can always buy a new lie
When yours is finally over
Either way you'll find a new life
When yours is finally over

Don't think I ever changed at all, my dear
And you'll see when I'm right
And here's when I'm wrong, but still
I kick myself in the face once again
Sometimes I think that I can kill the world
If just for a day
But I'd just be stuck with myself again
And I don't think I wanna be my only friend

You can always buy a new lie
When yours is finally over
Either way you'll find a new life
When yours is finally over

Someone standing alone on a hill
I think you're sinking, can't swim or sit still
Still he's waiting there alone
He's drowning on his own

The fool, who fell in love, left his heart right in the sink
She tore it all to pieces when he left it there
The fool, who fell in love, let his heart wash down the drain
She threw away the pieces when he left it there

Talkin' to myself
Fallin' from the shelf

Still I wonder why I ever let myself, take my own advice
Still I wonder why I ever let myself, take my own advice

Still he's waiting, a man on a hill
I think he's drifting, to float on the wind
Must be a fool to think he could
Bring him back to her

A fool, who fell in love, left his heart right in the sink
She tore it all to pieces when he left it there
A fool, who fell in love, let his heart wash down the drain
She threw away the pieces when he left it there

Talkin' to myself
Fallin' from the shelf

Still I wonder why I ever let myself, take my own advice
Still I wonder why I ever let myself, take my own advice

Can you figure out what I want,
pull the trigger with a pop gun
Mindless fools that aggravate it
pick at you in desperation

Oh it's a love pop suicide
Oh I'm in love pop suicide

Pop life living is so real
Midwest farmers' kids are milkfed
Breed and incubate what you see
Ten years later here on t.v.

Oh it's a love pop suicide
I'm in love pop suicide 

Father can't you love your women
Father can't you teach your children
Long range love implosion short wicked
Short wave mind explosion 

Oh I'm in love suicide, about a pop star homicide

I can't eat
I can't sleep
I can't live
I can't cry
I can't die
I can't walk
I can't talk
Booze
I can booze
Steal your shoes
So I can move
Tumble in the rough
Tumble in the rough
Tumble in the rough 

I'm looking for a new mediation
Still looking for a new way to fly
Don't want any plastic validation
Not looking for a new way to die

I made excuses for a million lies
But all I got was humble kidney pie
So what

I'm lookin' for a new stimulation
Quite bored of those inflatable ties
I'm lookin' for a new rock sensation
Dead fish don't swim around in jealous tides

I made excuses for a million lies
But all I got was humble kidney pie
So what

Can't hold you when I miss you
(Tumble in the Rough)
Left on a summer intermission
(Tumble in the Rough)
Can't hold you when I miss you
(Tumble in the Rough)
Left on a summer intermission
(Tumble in the Rough)

I got a picture of a photograph
Of a wedding and a shell
It's just a burning itching memory
I never kiss and tell

So turn it up and burn it
There's a hole in your head
There's a hole in your head
(Where the birds can't sing along)
Does anybody know how the story really goes?
How the story really goes
(Or do we all just hum along)

Sell your soul and sign an autograph
Big bang baby, it's a crash, crash, crash
I wanna cry, but I gotta laugh
Orange crush mama is a laugh, laugh, laugh

Spin me up, spin me, spin me out
Station to station send me up and out
Is this what life and love is all about
I think I think so

We used to see in color
Now it's only black and white
Yeah, it's only black and white
('Cause the world is color blind)
Does anybody know how the story really goes?
How the story really goes
(Or do we all just hum along)

Sell your soul and sign an autograph
Big bang baby, it's a crash, crash, crash
I wanna cry, but I gotta laugh
Orange crush mama is a laugh, laugh, laugh

Nothing's for free
Nothing's for free
Take it away boys
Nothing's for free
Nothing's for free
Take it away boys

So turn it up and burn it
There's a hole in your head
There's a hole in your head
(Where the birds can't sing along)
Does anybody know how the story really goes?
How the story really goes
(Or do we all just hum along)

Sell your soul and sign an autograph
Big bang baby, it's a crash, crash, crash
I wanna cry, but I gotta laugh
Orange crush mama is a laugh, laugh, laugh

Nothing's for free
Nothing's for free

Nothing's for free
Nothing's for free
Take it away boys

So turn it up and burn it
There's a hole in your head
A hole in your head
(Where the birds can't sing along)
Does anybody know how the story really goes?
How the story really goes
Or do we all just hum along

Lady picture show, she hides behind the bedroom door
Lady picture show she hides behind the bedroom wall
he hides because she don't know nothin', don't know nothin' anymore
She keeps a funny face it's locked and bagged it's just outside the door

She doesn't know her name
She doesn't know her face
She doesn't know her name
She doesn't know her face anymore
And don't believe

Lady picture girl, I think them boys don't like your show
Lady picture show them boys are gone, should just say no

Your wedding presents' not so daisy picture perfect anymore
Lady funny face it's locked and bagged it's just outside the oor
Don't know nothin' anymore

And so I know, it's begun again
Never be the same, and with that I said
Never ever be this way again
Hold on till the end (campfire girls make me feel alright)
(Campfire girls make me feel alright)

Like it's the last hello
Whirlwinds and rollercoasters
Long grass making shapes hello
Disappearing, disappearing floating graves
Never, ever, ever, ever be this way
Never ever be this way again
And so I know (campfire girls make me feel alright)
(Campfire girls make me feel alright)

It's begun again
Never the same, and with that I said
Campfire girls, make me feel alright

Don't cut out my paper heart
I ain't dyin' anyway 
Take a look at eye full towers
Never trust them dirty liars 

Sippin' lemon yellow booze
Old lead-belly sings the blues
All dressed up on wedding day
Keep on trippin' anyway

I am I am I said I'm not myself
I'm not dead and I'm not for sale
So keep your bankroll lottery
Eat your salad day
Deathbed motorcade

Fake the heat and scratch the itch
Skinned up knees and salty lips
I'll breathe your life Vicks vapor life
And when you binge I purge alike

Let go it's harder holding on
One more trip and I'll be gone
So keep your head up, keep it on
Just a whisper I'll be gone

Take a breath and make it big
It's the last you'll ever get 
Break your neck with diamond noose
It's the last you'll ever choose

I am I am I said I'm not myself
I'm not dead and I'm not for sale
Hold me closer, closer let me go
Let me be just let me be

I am I am I said I'm not myself
I'm not dead and I'm not for sale
So keep your bankroll lottery
Eat your salad day
Deathbed motorcade

I am I am I said I'm not myself
I'm not dead and I'm not for sale
Hold me closer, closer let me go
Let me be just let me be

I am I am I said I'm not myself
I'm not dead and I'm not for sale
So keep your bankroll lottery
Eat your salad day
Deathbed motorcade

I gotta girlfriend, she goes to art school
I gotta art school girlfriend yeah
I gotta girlfriend, she gotta girlfriend
We gotta girlfriend, girlfriend gotta go
She left her home from sweet Alabama
Rose Alabama for the city, New York City yeah
I told you five or four times
I gotta girlfriend, she goes to parties
Underground parties, Andy Warhol everywhere
She wears the leather, I wear the makeup
We'll never break up, been together for a month
She left her home from Sweet Alabama
Rose Alabama for the city, New York City yeah
I told you five or four times

My friend Blue he runs the show
With hot pink purple china glow
His family trees are molded
no longer grows in summer
He holds it closer lets it go
Picks a fruit but keeps it whole
Can't keep the submarining
Can't keep the light from fading

Grab the hate and drown it out
Grab the beat and drum it out
It's all so confusing 

Ain't the same for you and me
Cartoons like reality dogs and cats and children
The deepest wound is hidden
Ain't the same for you and me
Comatose commodity the superheroes dyin'
All the children cryin'
Sell more records if I'm dead
Purple flowers once again
Hope it's sooner. Hope it's near corporate records' fiscal year
Down the river, down the river

Have a listen lend an ear
Here's a song now if ya care
We can all just hum along
Words don't matter anymore

Grab the hate and drown it out
Grab the beat and drum it out
It's all so confusing 

Adhesive love adhesive

Flyin' high across the plain
Purple flowers ease the pain
Here, now have a listen
Ain't the songs you're missin'
Down the river, down the river

Stitch the womb and wet the bed with a whisper I'll be dead
Don't let the living die yet! Grab the hate...
Drown it out. Grab the beat...
Drum it out. It's all so confusing

Adhesive Love Adhesive

She no wait, but she know me
Intake purge, it's my disease

Hold me closer let me be
Hold me closer let me go away
Barely know you know my name
Trip the witch and ride the shame

Just because you're so cliched
It don't mean you won't get paid

Pass the time kickin' as time rips by
Neither goose nor the gander fly
Buy a minute spend an hour burnin', burnin'
Take a peak as the model earns it, earns it
Walk a mile as it keeps crawlin', crawlin'
Clean the politician, wash with everpure

So the answer gets harder, harder
And the truth's getting farther and farther
And the bottle keeps churnin' and churnin'
Seven caged tigers fly

Wastin' time chasin' those cows that fly
Churnin' out all that butterfly sugarboost
Track the blade as it sweeps downward and onward
Take a pill it'll kill all the martyrs, martyrs
Passin' time rippin' as time kicks by
Pass the umbilical cord down for this fly by
Take a sneak while the model earns it earns it
Hike a mile as it keeps crawlin' on crawlin' on
