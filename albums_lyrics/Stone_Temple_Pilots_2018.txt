"Middle Of Nowhere"

Don't fall in love with the midnight train
'Cuz it'll leave you in the Middle of Nowhere
The criminals have this all contained
That's why you shouldn't come back 'til it's over

The propaganda's oh-so soothin'
But I think you should aim a bit lower
You don't like what I have to say
But there's nothing you can say because
There's nothing you can do about it

'Cuz there's a right way
And there's a wrong way
And then there's my way
You better not forget it

She fell in love with a simple man
But he'll leave you in the Middle of Nowhere
She doesn't want what you're offering
That's why you shouldn't come back 'til you're older

The propaganda's oh-so soothin'
But I think you should aim a bit lower
You don't like what I have to say
But there's nothing you can say because
There's nothing you can do about it

'Cuz there's a right way
And there's a wrong way
And then there's my way
You better not forget it
You better not forget it
You better not forget it
You better not forget it
You better not forget it

Don't fall in love with the midnight train
'Cuz it'll leave you in the Middle of Nowhere
The criminals have this all contained
That's why you shouldn't come back 'til it's over
You better not forget it

The propaganda's oh-so soothin'
But I think you should aim a bit lower
You don't like what I have to say
But there's nothing you can say because
There's nothing you can do about it

'Cuz there's a right way
And there's a wrong way
And then there's my way
You better not forget it
You better not forget it
You better not forget it
You better not forget it
You better not forget it

"Guilty"

Spread the news don't you feel much better
The cenacles are afraid to die
What's the truth but an open letter
By the clowns soaked in pesticide

Realize
You're gonna pay the price
You're gonna pay tonight

Some don't but to have is better
I got lost there along the way
I don't care for the change in weather
I let go to come back again
Realize
I'm guilty in my ways

Heard the news and it ain't much better
The innocent try to stay alive
Every time there's a real go getter
Falling down in the well that's dry

Realize
You're gonna pay the price
You're gonna pay tonight

Some don't but to have is better
I got lost there along the way
I don't care for the change in weather
I let go to come back again
Realize
I'm guilty in my ways

"Meadow"

Rise and shine, Clementine
There's just something about you
Do you think you could dance
Cause I'm willing to stay fade away
And ride on

Sing a song, make it long
Cause there's nothing without you
All I need is a chance
And I'm willing to play, night or day
And ride on, on and on

And we're all...
Yeah, we're all just killing time and having fun
Here in the sun

When there's nowhere to hide
Yeah we're gonna sip on
As we drink from the fire
That was burning in the meadow
With luck in our eyes
And the stains of our souls
We can drink from the fire
That was burning in the meadow

You'll be mine, Clementine
'Cause I can't live without you
I've got something to say
But you've already made
Made your way, so ride on
When you're gone, here's a song
I'll be thinking about you
I'll remember your ways
And the thrills that you gave, gave away
So ride on, on and on

And we're all...
Yeah, we're all just killing time and having fun
Here in the sun

When there's nowhere to hide
Yeah we're gonna sip on
As we drink from the fire
That was burning in the meadow
With luck in our eyes
And the stains of our souls
We can drink from the fire
That was burning in the meadow

I gave you all you gave another
I hold the wheel, you light the flame

When there's nowhere to hide
Yeah we're gonna sip on
As we drink from the fire
That was burning in the meadow
With luck in our eyes
And the stains of our souls
We can drink from the fire
That was burning in the meadow

"Just A Little Lie"

Step inside the maiden ride
It helps if you don't breathe
Patronize and criticize
And welcome to the scene

I hope it comes out right
It's just a little lie

Hide behind another crime
The benefit's so sweet
It's alright it's just this time
The purity's unclean

I hope it comes out right
It's just a little lie

It's the only way to go from here
The only way to go from here

Realize just what's inside
We sink before we bleed
Some may run and some may hide
But that's alright with me

I hope it comes out right
It's just a little lie

It's the only way to go from here
The only way to go from here
From here

"Six Eight"

Wait, come get lost in my reflection
But there's nothing honey to help ease the soul, yeah

There's nobody to carry us now
There's no one when we're out here alone
It's all fighting and violence
Now that we've made it this far on our own

Oh, in the violence now
And it all stays the same
All gets wasted
And it all stays the same
In the violence now

Wait, we've exhausted all direction
There's nowhere to hide when you can't ease the soul, no

There's nobody to carry us now
There's no one when we're out here alone
It's all fighting and violence
Now that we've made it this far on our own

Oh, in the violence now
And it all stays the same
All gets wasted
And it all stays the same
In the violence now

Oh, in the violence now
And it all stays the same
All gets wasted
And it all stays the same
In the violence now

"Thought She'd Be Mine"

I swim in oceans of blue sky Autumn hazy
They tell me it's only you
Anticipating the one thing that could save me
But something's not right with the moon
Every time I get by I get closer to thinking
And we don't need that again
I've been sinking in blue eyed Autumn baby
Still thinking back to when

I thought she'd be mine
Thought she'd be mine
I thought she'd be mine
Thought she'd be mine
I thought she'd be mine
Mine in the morning

I walk the streets out of time so tired and lonely
Never to be the same
It could've been something beautiful if only
I opened my eyes too late
Every time that I try words get lost in the wind
And we don't need that again
I've been thinking of blue eyed Autumn baby
I used to remember when

I thought she'd be mine
Thought she'd be mine
I thought she'd be mine
Thought she'd be mine
I thought she'd be mine
Mine in the morning

I thought she'd be mine
Thought she'd be mine
I thought she'd be mine
I thought she'd be mine
I thought she'd be mine
Mine in the morning
I thought she'd be mine
Mine in the morning

Mine in the morning
I thought she'd be mine
Mine in the morning
I thought she'd be mine
Mine in the morning

"Roll Me Under"

Do you believe in something beautiful
Between chaos and the light
You gave it all for something you once sold
The truth be told you lied

If it's the taste you remember
You may not share in this sweet delight
Yeah we can live forever
If there's a time we can get it right

Roll me under, I'll pull the trigger for ya
Do with me what you will
Hold me under, the water running over
Do with me what you will

Are you receiving nothing once again
Is there shame for what's been done
It screams so loud that you can't begin
'Cuz you're always on the run

If it's the taste you remember
You may not share in this sweet delight
Yeah we can live forever
If there's a time we can get it right

Roll me under, I'll pull the trigger for ya
Do with me what you will
Hold me under, the water running over
Do with me what you will

Roll me under, I'll pull the trigger for ya
Do with me what you will
Hold me under, the water running over
Do with me what you will
Do with me what you will

"Never Enough"

You're all bark
But no bite
It's alright
You'll live a little
It's okay
You're on fire
You have style
It's just a little wild

What a poor little baby
Ah, such a poor little baby

No, it's never enough
You hide it away
Where no one can touch

Now you tell me
That you can do better
But we both know you can't
'Cause you'll never
Put away your anarchy
'Cause now we both know
That you're no good for me

In the dark
Without light
It's alright
You'll live a little
It's okay
You conspire
With desire
It's just a little wild

What a poor little baby
Ah, such a poor little baby

No, it's never enough
You hide it away
Where no one can touch

Now you tell me
That you can do better
But we both know you can't
'Cause you'll never
Put away your anarchy
'Cause now we both know
That you're no good for me

No, this is never enough
You hide it away
Where no one can touch
It's never enough
It's just never enough
You hide it away
Where no one can touch

Now you tell me
That you can do better
But we both know you can't
'Cause you'll never
Put away your anarchy
'Cause now we both know
That you're no good for me
No good for me

"The Art Of Letting Go"

You can drive, you don't even know me
I don't mind, I'll just take the back seat
Close my eyes, 'cause I just need to rest now
I'm so tired, from always running in and out

Get in line, just another repeat
Keep in time, we're moving to the new beat
Close my eyes, 'cause I just need to rest now
I'm so tired, from always running in and out

Of all the places I have gone
And all the faces I have known
They never seem to feel like home
And now it's time for letting go

I hope to see your smile again
But some day's far too long of a road

The art of letting go
I may be setting myself up to have to
Walk the streets alone
For letting go

You can drive, I don't even know me
Take your time, it's only for the lonely
It's in your eyes, and I don't need to rest now
I'm alright, it's never hard to figure out

Find the time, we don't need a repeat
Keep in mind, we're moving to a new beat
A rise in tide, out there is the feeling
I'm so tired, but only when I'm breathing

Of all the places I have gone
And all the faces I have known
They never seem to feel like home
And now it's time for letting go

I hope to see your smile again
But some day's far too long of a road

The art of letting go
I may be setting myself up to have to
Walk the streets alone
For letting go

I hope to see your smile again
But some day's far too long of a road

The art of letting go
I may be setting myself up to have to
Walk the streets alone
For letting go

"Finest Hour"

You never said goodbye
It left a void that's like no other
I know because it's true

A darkness hid inside
Another storm has scorned another
I know because of you

And now
I know the pressure you were under
Behind your eyes there lied a war
I never thought you'd be another
Another thought and I was up
Here in your finest hour
This is your finest hour

I won't forget that smile
It was contagious like no other
I know because it's true

I'll hold our precious time
Up to the sky, I'll miss you brother
I hope you know it's true

And now
I know the pressure you were under
Behind your eyes there lied a war
I never thought you'd be another
Another thought and I was up
Here in your finest hour
This is your finest hour
Here in your finest hour
This is your finest hour

And now
I know the pressure you were under
Behind your eyes there lied a war
I never thought you'd be another
Another thought and I was up
Here in your finest hour
This is your finest hour
Here in your finest hour
This is your finest hour

"Good Shoes"

A new tradition
Go put your good shoes on
what's your position
And where do you belong

Let's break away from these
These ties before we're gone

Repeat transmission
Thought you were nearly on
I dig your revision
Let's play your favorite song

Let's break away from these
These ties that should be gone

I'm going down, down, down
I hope she lets me in
I'm going down, down, down
I hope she lets me in

The first decision
The one that puts you on
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Let's break away my sweet
'Cause soon we will be gone

I'm going down, down, down
I hope she lets me in
I'm going down, down, down
I hope she lets me in

There comes a day when you say
That you're left here all alone
There comes a time when you find
That you're out here all alone

I'm going down, down, down
I hope she lets me in
I'm going down, down, down
I hope she lets me in

"Reds & Blues"

I've had no tolerance for days
What's that color that you use
Forever
In my experimental phase
All these colors that turn blue
Together

I'd rather sleep out on the Avenue
Than hold onto those pieces
Of all the things you thought you never knew
You're better off wrong

Midnight afternoon
A window I can't see through
When I'm in my reds & blues

Welcome the monumental haze
All the wonder we once knew
Forever
There's been no sleep for several days
The struggle we went through
Together

I'd rather sleep out on the Avenue
Than hold onto those pieces
Of all the things you thought you never knew
You're better off wrong

And where you lie is where a flower grows
Won't make a sound for the brand new day

Midnight afternoon
A window I can't see through
When I'm in my reds & blues
