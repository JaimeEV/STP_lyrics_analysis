"Pop's Love Suicide"

Can you figure out what I want,
pull the trigger with a pop gun
Mindless fools that aggravate it
pick at you in desperation

Oh it's a love pop suicide
Oh I'm in love pop suicide

Pop life living is so real
Midwest farmers' kids are milkfed
Breed and incubate what you see
Ten years later here on t.v.

Oh it's a love pop suicide
I'm in love pop suicide 

Father can't you love your women
Father can't you teach your children
Long range love implosion short wicked
Short wave mind explosion 

Oh I'm in love suicide, about a pop star homicide

"Tumble In The Rough"

I can't eat
I can't sleep
I can't live
I can't cry
I can't die
I can't walk
I can't talk
Booze
I can booze
Steal your shoes
So I can move
Tumble in the rough
Tumble in the rough
Tumble in the rough 

I'm looking for a new mediation
Still looking for a new way to fly
Don't want any plastic validation
Not looking for a new way to die

I made excuses for a million lies
But all I got was humble kidney pie
So what

I'm lookin' for a new stimulation
Quite bored of those inflatable ties
I'm lookin' for a new rock sensation
Dead fish don't swim around in jealous tides

I made excuses for a million lies
But all I got was humble kidney pie
So what

Can't hold you when I miss you
(Tumble in the Rough)
Left on a summer intermission
(Tumble in the Rough)
Can't hold you when I miss you
(Tumble in the Rough)
Left on a summer intermission
(Tumble in the Rough)

"Big Bang Baby"

I got a picture of a photograph
Of a wedding and a shell
It's just a burning itching memory
I never kiss and tell

So turn it up and burn it
There's a hole in your head
There's a hole in your head
(Where the birds can't sing along)
Does anybody know how the story really goes?
How the story really goes
(Or do we all just hum along)

Sell your soul and sign an autograph
Big bang baby, it's a crash, crash, crash
I wanna cry, but I gotta laugh
Orange crush mama is a laugh, laugh, laugh

Spin me up, spin me, spin me out
Station to station send me up and out
Is this what life and love is all about
I think I think so

We used to see in color
Now it's only black and white
Yeah, it's only black and white
('Cause the world is color blind)
Does anybody know how the story really goes?
How the story really goes
(Or do we all just hum along)

Sell your soul and sign an autograph
Big bang baby, it's a crash, crash, crash
I wanna cry, but I gotta laugh
Orange crush mama is a laugh, laugh, laugh

Nothing's for free
Nothing's for free
Take it away boys
Nothing's for free
Nothing's for free
Take it away boys

So turn it up and burn it
There's a hole in your head
There's a hole in your head
(Where the birds can't sing along)
Does anybody know how the story really goes?
How the story really goes
(Or do we all just hum along)

Sell your soul and sign an autograph
Big bang baby, it's a crash, crash, crash
I wanna cry, but I gotta laugh
Orange crush mama is a laugh, laugh, laugh

Nothing's for free
Nothing's for free
Take it away boys
Nothing's for free
Nothing's for free
Take it away boys

So turn it up and burn it
There's a hole in your head
A hole in your head
(Where the birds can't sing along)
Does anybody know how the story really goes?
How the story really goes
Or do we all just hum along

"Lady Picture Show"

Lady picture show, she hides behind the bedroom door
Lady picture show she hides behind the bedroom wall
he hides because she don't know nothin', don't know nothin' anymore
She keeps a funny face it's locked and bagged it's just outside the door

She doesn't know her name
She doesn't know her face
She doesn't know her name
She doesn't know her face anymore
And don't believe

Lady picture girl, I think them boys don't like your show
Lady picture show them boys are gone, should just say no

Your wedding presents' not so daisy picture perfect anymore
Lady funny face it's locked and bagged it's just outside the oor
Don't know nothin' anymore

"And So I Know"

And so I know, it's begun again
Never be the same, and with that I said
Never ever be this way again
Hold on till the end (campfire girls make me feel alright)
(Campfire girls make me feel alright)

Like it's the last hello
Whirlwinds and rollercoasters
Long grass making shapes hello
Disappearing, disappearing floating graves
Never, ever, ever, ever be this way
Never ever be this way again
And so I know (campfire girls make me feel alright)
(Campfire girls make me feel alright)

It's begun again
Never the same, and with that I said
Campfire girls, make me feel alright

"Trippin' On A Hole In A Paper Heart"

Don't cut out my paper heart
I ain't dyin' anyway 
Take a look at eye full towers
Never trust them dirty liars 

Sippin' lemon yellow booze
Old lead-belly sings the blues
All dressed up on wedding day
Keep on trippin' anyway

I am I am I said I'm not myself
I'm not dead and I'm not for sale
So keep your bankroll lottery
Eat your salad day
Deathbed motorcade

Fake the heat and scratch the itch
Skinned up knees and salty lips
I'll breathe your life Vicks vapor life
And when you binge I purge alike

Let go it's harder holding on
One more trip and I'll be gone
So keep your head up, keep it on
Just a whisper I'll be gone

Take a breath and make it big
It's the last you'll ever get 
Break your neck with diamond noose
It's the last you'll ever choose

I am I am I said I'm not myself
I'm not dead and I'm not for sale
Hold me closer, closer let me go
Let me be just let me be

I am I am I said I'm not myself
I'm not dead and I'm not for sale
So keep your bankroll lottery
Eat your salad day
Deathbed motorcade

I am I am I said I'm not myself
I'm not dead and I'm not for sale
Hold me closer, closer let me go
Let me be just let me be

I am I am I said I'm not myself
I'm not dead and I'm not for sale
So keep your bankroll lottery
Eat your salad day
Deathbed motorcade

"Art School Girl"

I gotta girlfriend, she goes to art school
I gotta art school girlfriend yeah
I gotta girlfriend, she gotta girlfriend
We gotta girlfriend, girlfriend gotta go
She left her home from sweet Alabama
Rose Alabama for the city, New York City yeah
I told you five or four times
I gotta girlfriend, she goes to parties
Underground parties, Andy Warhol everywhere
She wears the leather, I wear the makeup
We'll never break up, been together for a month
She left her home from Sweet Alabama
Rose Alabama for the city, New York City yeah
I told you five or four times

"Adhesive"

My friend Blue he runs the show
With hot pink purple china glow
His family trees are molded
no longer grows in summer
He holds it closer lets it go
Picks a fruit but keeps it whole
Can't keep the submarining
Can't keep the light from fading

Grab the hate and drown it out
Grab the beat and drum it out
It's all so confusing 

Ain't the same for you and me
Cartoons like reality dogs and cats and children
The deepest wound is hidden
Ain't the same for you and me
Comatose commodity the superheroes dyin'
All the children cryin'
Sell more records if I'm dead
Purple flowers once again
Hope it's sooner. Hope it's near corporate records' fiscal year
Down the river, down the river

Have a listen lend an ear
Here's a song now if ya care
We can all just hum along
Words don't matter anymore

Grab the hate and drown it out
Grab the beat and drum it out
It's all so confusing 

Adhesive love adhesive

Flyin' high across the plain
Purple flowers ease the pain
Here, now have a listen
Ain't the songs you're missin'
Down the river, down the river

Stitch the womb and wet the bed with a whisper I'll be dead
Don't let the living die yet! Grab the hate...
Drown it out. Grab the beat...
Drum it out. It's all so confusing

Adhesive Love Adhesive

"Ride The Cliche"

She no wait, but she know me
Intake purge, it's my disease

Hold me closer let me be
Hold me closer let me go away
Barely know you know my name
Trip the witch and ride the shame

Just because you're so cliched
It don't mean you won't get paid

"Seven Caged Tigers"

Pass the time kickin' as time rips by
Neither goose nor the gander fly
Buy a minute spend an hour burnin', burnin'
Take a peak as the model earns it, earns it
Walk a mile as it keeps crawlin', crawlin'
Clean the politician, wash with everpure

So the answer gets harder, harder
And the truth's getting farther and farther
And the bottle keeps churnin' and churnin'
Seven caged tigers fly

Wastin' time chasin' those cows that fly
Churnin' out all that butterfly sugarboost
Track the blade as it sweeps downward and onward
Take a pill it'll kill all the martyrs, martyrs
Passin' time rippin' as time kicks by
Pass the umbilical cord down for this fly by
Take a sneak while the model earns it earns it
Hike a mile as it keeps crawlin' on crawlin' on
