"Heaven & Hot Rods"

You can get it if you really want it
But you better off just leave it alone
You won't forget it if you ever had it
So you're better off just stayin' at home
She walked in with her alligator sister
Trying to get to heaven on Sunday
You'll never get it
If you never had it
So better off just leave it alone

And the dogs came in
Just to see her smile
Just to see her smile

You don't get it, no, you won't forget
So you're better off just leave it alone
If you don't stop thinkin'
Soon you will be drinkin'
And you're better off just stayin' at home

And the dogs came in
Just to see her smile
And the gods came in
Just to see her smile
Just to see her smile

Coming down
Mom I'm still healin'
Coming down
Oh, and I'm still breathing
Coming down

"Pruno"

Falling downward with a flaming hand
I knew the questions but I lost the answers
I'll hold the world for all
I'll hold it for all
As long as no one asks no questions

I got the message
And the message stood
One, two, three
I got another, got another
One, two, three
I got another, got another
I got another hit that held me the last time
Don't ya know what I mean boys?
One, two, three
I got another, got another

Falling fast but doing all I can
I know the questions but I lost the answers
I got the message and the message stood
Lease the one who makes it
Profit from the riddle
Kill the one that breaks it
Always in the middle
Keep the dream alive
With sleeping pills you shouldn't fiddle
Lease the one that makes it
Profit from the riddle
I got the message but I lost the answers
I got the message but I lost the answers

"Church On Tuesday"

And I don't believe it
Is she really gone again?
And I don't believe it
Is she really gone again?

I'll find a way to you someday
I'll find a way to you someday

Father's always smoking
And your mom's at church on Tuesday
And your brother's always drinking and dyin'

And I don't believe it
Is she really gone again?

"Sour Girl"

She turned away, what was she looking at?
She was a sour girl the day that she met me
Hey! What are you looking at?
She was a happy girl the day that she left me
She turned away what was she looking at?
She was a sour girl the day that she met me
Hey! What are you looking at?
She was a happy girl when she left me

What would you do?
What would you do if I followed you?
What would you do if I follow?

Don't turn away, what are you looking at?
He was so happy on the day that he met her
Say, what are you looking at?
I was a superman, but looks are deceiving

The rollercoaster rides a lonely one
I paid a ransom note to stop it from steaming
Hey! What are you looking at?
She was a teenage girl when she met me

What would you do?
What would you do if I followed you?
What would you do if I follow?

The girl got reasons, they all got reasons

Hey! What are you looking at?
She was a happy girl the day that she left me
The day that she left me
She was a happy girl the day that she left me
She was a sour girl the day that she met
The day that she left me

"No Way Out"

I'm going under, I'm suffocating
Drowning but I'm holding on
What keeps me breathing? Don't have an answer
I'm drowning but I won't let go

Away now, no way out
Away now, no way out

I've been a walkin' a lonesome highway
I felt as though I had no home
My bed's been taken by another I made the bed, now lie alone

Keep it away now motherfucker, now keep it away
Keep it away now motherfucker, now keep it away

Away now, no way out
Away now, no way out

"Sex & Violence"

I used to love you now I don't care
Now I turn around, you're everywhere
So you can chew me up and spit me out
You're just a little bitch I cared about

I know you can see me
But you don't believe me
I know that you're lonely
Time will tell and time is hell

No sex or violence
No morbid silence
Forever sleeping
You won't stop breathing

You hold me captive and it's not fair
Progressed insanity is everywhere
You need to love me but you kicked me out
My head is wandering so knock me out
I keep my head afloat I'm drownin' in
The muddy water pulls me down again
I used to love me but I hate me now
I'm just a little bitch I cared about

"Glide"

Torment the tortured, teach me things
I'm so alive
Speak to the speechless, seek the things
You have inside
You can hunt for the hunter
He's got nowhere to hide
You can seek with the seeker
But hold on for the ride

Keep it coming I'm going all the way
Keep it coming I'm going all the way

Just give me half a chance
From throwing it all away
Run to the place that hides the pain
You have inside
Cover my chain it hides the strain
Only to glide
You can hunt for the hunter
He's got nowhere to hide
You can seek with the seeker
But hold on for the ride
There's nowhere to turn, nowhere to run
You can fly with the fader, fly it. Fly it on the run

It's too late, the time is gone
Later on again 'cause no one's leaving
Look away

"I Got You"

I got you
But it's the craving for the good life
That sees me through trouble times
When my mind begins to wander to the spoon

And I got you
Because you're there to bend and nurture me through these
Troubled times
'Cause the fix begins to twist my troubled mind

And I got you to paint the sorry on my day
And I got you to paint the roses on my grave
And I got you

I got you
But it's the feeling that I get when you're away
Twist my mind 'cause when I'm alone and cold, I fell like dyin'
And I got you to fill the craving that I get inside my mind
When you're there to fill the space I have inside, I feel like cryin'

And I got you to paint the sorrow on my day
And I got you to paint the roses on my grave
And I got you

All the slippin' that I slap me
I got you, I got you
All the slippin' that I slap me

"MC5"

No you don't get
No you don't want it
No you don't get it, no

No you don't get
No you don't want it
No you don't get it, no

She don't like the way she smiles
He don't like the way she smiles
Son of a bitch
I know what the itch is like
You won't get enough
She don't like the way she smiles
(Don't want you)
He don't like the way she smiles
(Don't need you)
She don't like the way she smiles
(Can't have you)
He don't like the way she smiles
(I want)

No you don't get it
You'll never get it
No you don't get it
I want to see through you

No you don't get it
You'll never get it
No you don't get it
I want to see through you, Now!

"Atlanta"

She lives in a bungalow
She kills me with rosegarden thorns
She waits for me
My love is unusual
It's painted with roses and thorns
with her I'm complete

She lives by the wall
and waits by the door
She walks in the sun
to me

Visions of Mexico seduce me
It goes to my head so carefully
Memories of candles and incense
And all of these things remember these

She lives by the wall
and waits by the door
She walks in the sun
to me

She comforts me when
the candles blow out
the cake has grown mold
but the memories are sweet
The laughter's all gone
but the memories are mine
The Mexican princess
is out of my life

She lives by the wall
and waits by the door
She walks in the sun
to me
