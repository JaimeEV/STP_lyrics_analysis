"Meatplow"

Fine place for a day full of breakdowns
Takes more than a meltdown to show us how
Throw a tack on the road, stop the meatplow
Got a bullet but it ain't mine

They got these pictures of everything
To break us down, yeah to break me down
They make us hate and we make it bleed

But I got a lover and yeah she shows me how
To understand it, yeah to understand
I got a brother and well he show me how
To make amends, yeah to make amends with it

Take a break from the mousetrap we call home
Takes more than a message to make me smile
I can feel when she kisses me sleeping
But not when the news is on

They got these pictures of everything
To break us down, yeah to break me down
They make us hate and we make it bleed

But I got a lover and yeah she shows me how
To understand it, yeah to understand
I got a brother and well he show me how
To make amends, yeah to make amends with it

They got these pictures of everything
To break us down, yeah to break me down
They make us hate and we make it bleed

But I got a lover and yeah she shows me how
To understand it, yeah to understand
I got a brother and well he show me how
To make amends, yeah to make amends with it

"Vasoline"

One time a thing occurred to me
What's real, and what's for sale?
Blew a kiss and tried to take it home

Isn't you, isn't me
Search for things that you can't see
Going blind, out of reach
Somewhere in the Vasoline

Two times and it has rendered me
Punch drunk and without bail
Think I'd be safer all alone

Flies in the Vasoline we are
Sometimes it blows my mind
Keep getting stuck here all the time

Isn't you, isn't me
Search for things that you can't see
Going blind, out of reach
Somewhere in the Vasoline

You'll see the look and you'll see the lies
You'll eat the lies, and you will.

Flies in the Vasoline we are
Sometimes it blows my mind
Keep getting stuck here all the time

It isn't you, isn't me
Search for things that you can't see
Going blind, out of reach
Somewhere in the Vasoline.

"Lounge Fly"

it's ok, it's ok, ok relieve me
pins in me, pins in me, in me you kill me
the lounge fly
the lounge fly
the fly you bring me
I think I'm free but the dogs they
won't release me

I can't give what I take away
and the other understands
she said she'd be my woman
she said she'd be my man
I can't live this way
please refill my soul

don't have a nickel or a dollar but
you feed me
my bottle's empty but you always
refuel me
I feel I'm sinking but you won't
let me drown me
I wanna fuck, wanna fuck
but do you need me?

"Interstate Love Song"

Waiting on a Sunday afternoon
For what I've read between the lines
Your lies
Feeling like a hand in rusted chains
So do you laugh at those who cry?
Reply

Leaving on a Southern train
Only yesterday you lied
Promises of what I seemed to be
Only watched the time go by
All of these things you said to me

Breathing is the hardest thing to do
With all I've said and all that's dead for you
You lied
Goodbye

Leaving on a Southern train
Only yesterday you lied
Promises of what I seemed to be
Only watched the time go by
All of these things I said to you

"Still Remains"

our bed we live, our bed we sleep
making love and I become you
flesh is warm with naked feet
stabbing thorns and you become me
oh, I'd beg for you. Oh, you know I'll beg for you.

pick a song and sing a yellow nectarine
take a bath, I'll drink the water that you leave
if you should die before me
ask if you can bring a friend
pick a flower, hold your breath
and drift away...

she holds my hand we share a laugh,
slipping orange blossom breezes
love is still and sweat remains
a cherished gift unselfish feeling...
oh, I'd beg for you. Oh, you know I'll beg for you.

pick a song and sing a yellow nectarine
take a bath, I'll drink the water that you leave
if you should die before me
ask if you can bring a friend
pick a flower, hold your breath
and drift away...

she tells me things, I listen well
drink the wine and save the water
skin is smooth, I steal a glance
dragon flies "er" gliding over...
oh, I'll beg for you. Oh, you know I'll beg for you.

pick a song and sing a yellow nectarine
take a bath, I'll drink the water that you leave
if you should die before me
ask if you can bring a friend
pick a flower, hold your breath
and drift away...

"Pretty Penny"

have you seen your mother girl?
has she gone away?
gone away and found the pearl
but the price she paid
gone
when you wake in the morning
gone
when you find that there's no one sleeping
gone
pretty penny was her name
she was loved and we all will miss her

how far will you go I say,
just to bait a mouse?
shorter lived and longer gone,
can you figure out?

have you lost your sister girl?
she's all but blown away
blown away and lost the pearl
and the price she paid

"Silvergun Superman"

find you in the dark
read you like a cheap surprise
without shame
sell me out, and frame your name

I can hear when the pig whispers sweetly
jealousy is the weapon you kill me
keep a dime for a truth you might tell
you toed the line, and I know it was mine
couldn't hide, write a wave, ride a lie
let me know, can I friend ask you why?

rolling back the days
with my friend I love to play
the "little one"
superman with silver gun

I can hear when the pig whispers sweetly
jealousy is the weapon you kill me
keep a dime for a truth you might tell

wait for me, take a dive take a piece of my life
(leave me numb)
wait for me, tell a lie, try to take my life
(leave me numb)
wait for me, take a dive take a piece of my life
(leave me numb)
close to me, and I'll leave you numb

"Big Empty"

Drivin' faster in my car
Falling farther from just what we are
Smoke a cigarette and lie some more
These conversations kill
Falling faster in my car

Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to take a ride
It leaves today no conversation
Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to wait too long
To wait too long
To wait too long

Too much walkin', shoes worn thin
Too much trippin' and my soul's worn thin
Time to catch a ride
It leaves today, her name is what it means
Too much walkin', shoe's worn thin

Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to take a ride
It leaves today no conversation
Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to wait too long
To wait too long
To wait too long

Conversations kill
Conversations kill
Conversations kill

Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to take a ride
It leaves today no conversation
Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to wait too long
To wait too long
To wait too long

Conversations kill
Conversations kill
Conversations kill

"Unglued"

moderation is masterbation
what is what, and what makes you feel good
all these things I think about,
I think about
always come unglued

yeah, I got this thing
it's comin' over me, I got thing
it's comin' over me, I got this feelin'
coming over me, yeah

this confusion is my illusion
nowhere to look, but know where
to find ya.
all these things I'm sick about,
I'm sick about
always come unglued

"Army Ants"

you don't look but you kick me
you can't feel but you hit me
you can't live with the way I pray

why we all have to look this way
I gotta heart, I got blood, feel pain

time, time is not on my side
cause the way I am
gotta gotta now gotta find the reason why
a woman ain't a man

you don't look but you kick me
you can't feel but you hit me
you can't deal with the way I pray

why do you all have to think this way
I gotta heart, I got blood, feel pain

fall in those single file lines
like army ants
yeah, fall on into those single file lines
and complete the plan

"Kitchenware & Candy Bars"

somebody told me, I know where to go
somebody showed me, I was last to know

sell me down the river
sell me down the river
sell me down the river
sell me down the river

what I wanted, is what I wanted
what I wanted is what she wanted

unfriendly feelings, down on wounded knee
unfriendly reasons, some blind mother's need

sell me down the river
sell me down the river
sell me down the river
sell me down the river

what I wanted, is what I wanted
what I wanted is what she wanted

you read the words and it sells you life
they sell their words, but it's all a lie
