"Out Of Time"

Longing is the animal inside you when you bleed
Suffering is critical in finding what you need
Deliverance is evidence there’s more than what you say
Pain is there the moment that you wake up from your dreams

Oh, I know you can’t tithe
Oh, when you look inside yourself
You’ve got to cross that line
Yeah, you’re running out of time

Loneliness is beautiful, it leads you home again
Happiness is overrated, joy is infinite
Liberate the hate you feel before it’s permanent
Smile when it hurts, it works like mother’s medicine

Oh, I know you can’t tithe
Oh, when you look inside yourself
you’ve got to cross that line
Yeah, you’re running out of time

You’ve got to learn your lesson to see what you’ve been missing
You’ve got to cross that line

Yeah, you’ve got to look inside
Yeah, it’s time that you decide
Yeah, you’ve got to cross that line
Yeah, you’re running out of time

"Black Heart"

Black heart's comin', he’s a cold machine
Cuts like a knife, gentle and clean
Face like an angel, mind of a killer
Nobody else gonna love her better

Lay down now stay down
Took her life with a quick pull trigger

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Well I don’t mind, I don’t mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Said I don’t mind if you don’t mind

The color is all but faded
Out of a dead man's eyes
Down to his blackened heart

Black heart's kickin' like a beating drum
Shooting her down the sound of his gun
No compassion, hard as an assassin
Falling deeper still in that reckless fashion

Lay down now stay down
Deeper and deeper with a blind man's passion

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Well I don’t mind, I don’t mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Said I don’t mind if you don’t mind

The color is all but faded
Out of a dead mans eyes
Down to his blackened heart

Rescue me
(If you don’t mind)
[x3]

If you don't mind
The color is all but faded
Out of a dead man's eyes
Down to his blackened heart
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

"Same On The Inside"

Sending out a message to the world
But I just can't seem to find the words
No one wants to die alone
Broken and insane
Question every last decision
Another empty page

Do you know the answers?
Tell me, I find my happy ending
When do we start pretending that
We're all the same on the inside

Wanting what I know won't satisfy
Just to live this, need to live a lie
Never meant to run away
Jumping out the train
My cage was built on good intentions
Running every page

Do you know the answers?
Tell me, I find my happy ending
When do we start pretending that
We're all the same on the inside

All the same on the inside
All the same on the inside

Do you want the answers?
Tell me, I find my happy ending
When do we start pretending that
We're all the same on the inside

All the same on the inside
We're all the same on the inside
We're all the same on the inside

Yeah, we're all the same on the inside

"Cry Cry"

Forgive the promise that is never kept
The wasted life that you have left
So sell your soul and put it on display
Echoing the debts that can’t be paid

Breathe in let go
The undertow

Will pull you in and throw you out of time
the shadow’s playing tricks on your broken mind

Tears will not cure the pain

Cry cry, can’t say no
Nothing cures a craving
Yeah yeah
Cry cry it’s all a show
Just a game you’re playing
Yeah yeah yeah

Yesterday is lost again
Collect the hours suffering in vein
So hold on tight watch the embers glow
The ashes fly away out of your control

Breath in let go
The undertow

Will pull you in and throw you out of time
the shadow’s playing tricks on your broken mind

Tears will not cure the pain

Cry cry, can’t say no
Nothing cures a craving
Yeah yeah
Cry cry it’s all a show
Just a game you’re playing
Yeah yeah yeah

Cry cry, can’t say no
Nothing cures a craving
Yeah yeah
Cry cry it’s all a show
Just a game you’re playing
Yeah yeah

Cry cry, can’t say no
Nothing cures a craving
Yeah yeah
Cry cry it’s all a show
Just a game you’re playing
Yeah yeah

"Tomorrow"

These endless days are wait for me
Tearing my heart that breaks for you
I'm coming home tomorrow

Though you're not lying next to me
I hear your song that calls to me
I'm coming home tomorrow
Back in your arms

Tomorrow's just a dream I can't detain
It's like a fall I can't contain
And though it seems so far away
It's just a day, a lonely day away

The summer's gone and I can see
The season's end is set me free
I'm coming home tomorrow
Back in your arms

Tomorrow's just a dream I can't detain
It's like a fall I can't contain
And though it seems so far away
It's just a day,
A lonely day away

Tomorrow I'm coming home
Tomorrow I'm coming home
I'm so tired and so alone

It's like a dream I can't detain
It's like a fall I can't contain
And though it seems so far away
It's just a day,
A lonely day away
