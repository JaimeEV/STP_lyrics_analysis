"Fare Thee Well"

Fare thee well so long
Hate to say goodbye to you
I can tell you're gone
By the way I'm missing you
Don't you realize you're everything to me?

Got my heart out in my hand and don't you know it?
Something deep inside's come over me
I'm gonna sacrifice my soul just to show it
Can you try to tell me what it means?

Could this be love? Love?
Coming over me
Coming over me
Could this be love?

When you're gone, I found
A part of me is there with you
Are you still all mine?
I hope you're telling me the truth
'Cause the saddest thing's when love goes away

Got my heart out in my hand and don't you know it?
Something deep inside's come over me
I'm gonna sacrifice my soul just to show it
Can you try to tell me what it means?

Could this be love? Love?
Coming over me
Coming over me
Could this be love?
Fare thee well

Got my heart out in my hand and don't you know it?
Something deep inside's come over me
I'm gonna sacrifice my soul just to show it
Can you try to tell me what it means?

Could this be love? Love?
Coming over me
Coming over me
Could this be love?

Fare thee well so long
Hate to say goodbye to you
I can tell you're gone
By the way I'm missing you
Don't you realize you're everything to me?
Don't you realize you're everything to me?

"Three Wishes"

Still in the morning sun
It was Saturday, if I don't mistake
And all that we've become
Turned to lullabies of love and heartache

It brings the rain
I hear your name
I wish you were ready
Ready for someone
When all is done
It's why you run
'Cause you were not ready
Ready for someone

Once and twice begun
These three wishes I cannot replace
And what would they become?
Turn to lullabies of love and heartache

It brings the rain
I hear your name
I wish you were ready
Ready for someone
When all is done
It's why you run
But you were not ready
Ready for someone

There's not much more left I can do or say
Your silence is telling the truth 'cause you walked away
'Cause you walked away

It brings the rain
I hear your name
I wish you were ready
Ready for someone
When all is done
It's why you run
But you were not ready
Ready for someone

"Perdida"

Thank you for the memories I'll carry
But time is said to move along
Never been one to do things gracefully
I know, for that, I'm always wrong

Oh, perdida, come and go
Stay with me tonight
But in the morning, please be gone

I know the changes are the ones you seek
I'm lost in circles most the time
As stronger reason gets the best of me
Behind the smile, I'm slowly dying

Oh, perdida, come and go
Stay with me tonight
But in the morning, please be gone
And oh, perdida visits me
I'll meet you in the sky
Where the winds turn into breeze

Oh, perdida, come and go
Stay with me tonight
But in the morning, please be gone
And oh, perdida visits me
I'll meet you in the sky
Where the winds turn into breeze

"I Didn't Know The Time"

You dream in color
But stare at cracks in the wall
You're in cloudy season
Always another
Another room down the hall
You grow tired of leaving

I wish I may, I wish I might
It won't be long now, we could spend the time
What do you wish for when you close your eyes?
And a tear tells me
You've never been good at goodbye

Do you remember
When you would take on the world?
But it's cloudy season
And stormy weather
Has been here for too long
You're so tired of leaving

I wish I may, I wish I might
It won't be long now, we could spend the time
What do you wish for when you close your eyes?
And a tear tells me
You've never been good at goodbye

I wish I may, I wish I might
It won't be long now, we could spend the time
What do you wish for when you close your eyes?
And a tear tells me
You've never been good at goodbye

"Years"

All alone, the years go by
Now they're gone I wonder why
We lived a lifetime only to say goodbye

Once there was a time when love was new
Remember when we said "I do"?
And now you've gone away
The years remember those days

Now we're here and after all
Who's to blame for what we lost?
Years have cracked through me with nowhere to hide
'Cause they know

Once there was a time when love was new
Remember when we said "I do"?
And now you've gone away
The years remember those days

"She's My Queen"

She's my Queen
She came from the northern sky and found me
She painted bright stars all around me
She's my soul, a melody, she's my Queen
She's my Queen
And just like a dream I could see her
She was meant for me and now I need her
She's my soul, a melody, she's my Queen

If I could count the ways (Oh yeah)
If I could count the ways I would (Oh yeah)
If I could count the ways (Oh yeah)
If I could count the ways I would (Oh yeah)

She's my Queen
And it took so long for me to find her
I want to spend my days here beside her
She's my soul, a melody, she's my Queen

If I could count the ways (Oh yeah)
If I could count the ways I would (Oh yeah)
If I could count the ways (Oh yeah)
If I could count the ways I would (Oh yeah)

She's my Queen
She came from the northern sky and found me
She painted bright stars all around me
She's my soul, a melody, she's my Queen

If I could count the ways (Oh yeah)
If I could count the ways I would (Oh yeah)
If I could count the ways (Oh yeah)
If I could count the ways I would (Oh yeah)

"Miles Away"

If time could rewind, that's the first thing I'd do
Now I bathe in the sound of echoes of you
I'd canvas the sea just to know what you knew
Wanna feel everything you've ever been through

You're so far from me I can honestly say
I'm longing for you, not just memories of you miles away

If I could stop time, that's the last thing I'd do
Just to savor the essence of echoes of you
Your absence so loud I could still see your face
These walls rearranging with each step I take

'Cause you're so far from me I can honestly say
I'm longing for you, not just memories of you miles away

If time could rewind, that's the first thing I'd do
Now I bathe in the essence of echoes of you
I would canvas the sea just to know what you knew
I wanna feel everything that you've ever been through

'Cause you're so far from me I can honestly say
I'm longing for you, not just memories of you miles away

I'm longing for you, not just memories of you miles away
I'm longing for you, not just memories of you miles away
I'm longing for you, not just memories of you miles away
I'm longing for you, not just memories of you miles away

"You Found Yourself While Losing Your Heart"

We don't need to love for all we know
We could just pretend that everyone is made of snow
So please forgive me if I seem out of line
Seal it with a kiss before you go

We're the lucky ones for all we know
We could find a reason but the reasons never show
So please forgive me if I seem out of line
Here's another kiss before you go

You found yourself while losing your heart
I hope that's all that you request
You found yourself while losing your heart
We can always reminisce
Tears become lies when they try to resist
And we can't deny that it's turned into this

Life has just begun for all we know
Find another reason to begin out on our own
So please forgive me if I seem out of line
And here's a final kiss before you go

You found yourself while losing your heart
I hope it's all that you request
You found yourself while losing your heart
We can always reminisce
Tears become lies when they try to resist
And we can't deny that it's turned into this

You found yourself while losing your heart
I hope it's all that you request
You found yourself while losing your heart
We can always reminisce
Tears become lies when they try to resist
And we can't deny that it's turned into this

"Sunburst"

A sunburst comes, a sunburst goes
Leaving behind more than anyone knows
Glimmer of light for a flower to grow
If you could stay for a moment what would we say?

A sunburst came, a sunburst gone
You can't be anywhere for too long
Yet you find everywhere to belong
If you could stay for a moment what would you even say?

Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
(I know, I know, I know)

A sunburst comes, a sunburst goes
Leaving behind more than anyone knows
Glimmer of light for a flower to grow
If you could stay for a moment what would we say?

Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
Be your sunburst again
