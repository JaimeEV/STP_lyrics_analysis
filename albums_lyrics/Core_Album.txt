"Dead & Bloated"

I am smellin' like the rose
that somebody gave me on
my birthday deathbed
I am smellin' like the rose
that somebody gave me
'cause I'm dead & bloated

I am smellin' like the rose
that somebody gave me on
my birthday deathbed
I am smellin' like the rose
that somebody gave me
'cause I'm dead & bloated

Ohh yeah, and she says it's natural
I feel I've come of age
When she peeks I start to run
Ohh yeah, and she says it's natural
I feel I've come of age
When she peeks I start to run

You can't swallow what I'm thinkin'
You can't swallow what I'm thinkin'

I am trampled under sole of
another man's shoes
Guess I walked too softly

Ohh yeah, and she says it's natural
I feel I've come of age
When she peeks I start to run
Ohh yeah, and she says it's natural
I feel I've come of age
When she peeks I start to run

You can't swallow what I'm thinkin'
You can't swallow what I'm thinkin'

I run through the world thinkin' 'bout tomorrow, thinkin' 'bout tomorrow
I run through the world thinkin' 'bout tomorrow, thinkin' 'bout tomorrow

I am smellin' like the rose
that somebody gave me on
my birthday deathbed
I am smellin' like the rose
that somebody gave me
'cause I'm dead & bloated

I run through the world thinkin' 'bout tomorrow, thinkin' 'bout tomorrow
I run through the world thinkin' 'bout tomorrow, thinkin' 'bout tomorrow
I run through the world thinkin' 'bout tomorrow, thinkin' 'bout tomorrow
I run through the world thinkin' 'bout tomorrow, thinkin' 'bout tomorrow

I am smellin' like the rose
that somebody gave me on
my birthday deathbed
I am smellin' like the rose
that somebody gave me, somebody gave me,
somebody gave me on
my birthday deathbed

"Wicked Garden"

Can you see like a child?
Can you see what I want?
I wanna run through your wicked garden
Heard that's the place to find you
Cause I'm alive
So alive now
I know the darkness blinds you

Can you see without eyes?
Can you speak without lies?
I wanna drink from you naked fountain
I can drown your sorrows
I'm gonna burn
Burn you to life now
Out of the chains that bind you

Can you see just like a child?
Can you see just what I want?
Can I bring you back to life?
Are you scared of life?

Burn, burn, burn
Burn your wicked garden down
Burn, burn, burn
Burn your wicked garden to the ground

Can you feel pain inside?
Can you love?
Can you cry?
I wanna run through your wicked garden
Heard that's the place to find you
But I'm alive
So alive now
Out of the dark that blinds you

Can you see just like a child?
Can you see just what I want?
Can I bring you back to life?
Are you scared of life?

Burn, burn, burn
Burn your wicked garden down
Burn, burn, burn
Burn your wicked garden to the ground

"Sin"

Holywater clouds my thinking
Sinking low now
Keep on drinking

Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me strong
Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me strong

You control me, soul you stole, mine
Wishful thinking
Six feet under

Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me strong
Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me strong

Dead by dreaming, sleep you steal, mine
Pools of cold sweat
Hatred burns me

Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me strong
Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me strong

Still shackled to the shadow
Still shackled to the shadow
That followed you...
Still shackled to the shadow
Still shackled to the shadow
That followed you...
Still shackled to the shadow
Still shackled to the shadow
That followed you...

"Naked Sunday"

You're the fuel to the fire
You're the weapons of war
You're the irony of justice
And the father of law

I've been waiting for awhile to meet you
For the chance to shake your hand
To give you thanks for all the suffering you command
And when all is over and we return to dust
Who will be my judge and which one do I trust

You're the champion of sorrow
You're the love and the pain
You're the fighter of evil
Yet you're one in the same

I've been waiting for awhile to meet you
For the chance to shake your hand
To give you thanks for all the suffering you command
And when all is over and we return to dust
Who will be my judge and which one do I trust?

"Creep"

Forward yesterday
Makes me wanna stay
What they said was real
Makes me wanna steal
Livin' under house
Guess I'm livin', I'm a mouse
All's I gots is time
Got no meaning, just a rhyme

Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal, I like to steal

I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
Well, I'm half the man I used to be, half the man I used to be

Feelin' uninspired
Think I'll start a fire
Everybody run
Bobby's got a gun
Think you're kinda neat
Then she tells me I'm a creep
Friends don't mean a thing
Guess I'll leave it up to me

Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
Guess I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal, I like to steal

I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
I'm half the man I used to be, half the man I used to be

Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
Guess I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal, I like to steal

I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
I'm half the man I used to be, half the man I used to be,
Half the man I used to be

"Piece Of Pie"

I broke the breadline
Nobody knows
I walked the frontline
Still got far to go

I mixed the water
I drank the water
I broke the breadline
Don't wanna know

It's staring me down
Wearing a crown of apathy
I'm standing around
Dressed like a clown
Don't know my name
You know where to find me

I killed the manchild
I'll fast alone
I had the midwife
Naked and alone

I mixed the water
I drank the water
I killed the brainchild
I'll fast alone

It's staring me down
Wearing a crown of apathy
I'm standing around
Dressed like a clown
Don't know my name
You know where to find me

Don't wanna let me be a man
Don't wanna lead me to your home

It's staring me down
Wearing a crown of apathy
I'm standing around
Dressed like a clown
Don't know my name
You know where to find me

I killed the manchild
I had the midwife
I drank the water
I stand alone

I broke the breadline
I walked the frontline
Don't know my name
You know where to find me

I killed the manchild
I had the midwife
I drank the water
I stand alone

I broke the breadline
I walked the frontline
Don't know my name
You know where to find me

Don't wanna let me be a man
Don't wanna lead me to your home
Don't wanna let me be a man
Don't wanna lead me to your home

"Plush"

And I feel that time's a wasted go
So where ya going 'til tomorrow?
And I see that these are lies to come
So would you even care?

And I feel it
And I feel it

Where ya going for tomorrow?
Where ya going with the mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel
When the dogs begin to smell her
Will she smell alone?

And I feel, so much depends on the weather
So is it raining in your bedroom?
And I see, that these are the eyes of disarray
Would you even care?

And I feel it
And she feels it

Where ya going for tomorrow?
Where ya going with the mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel
When the dogs begin to smell her
Will she smell alone?

When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it
When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it

Where ya going for tomorrow?
Where ya going with the mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel
When the dogs begin to smell her
Will she smell alone?

When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it
When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it
To find it
To find it
To find it

"Wet My Bed"

Hey everybody, where did Mary go?
Where did Mary go?
And where's my only cigarette?
Please think for me, I can't bare to
I'll just lie here for a while
Wet myself, wet my bed
I've readied it all for her, you know
Clean sheets, incense, a lots of fluffy pillows
Now soiled
And where's my cigarette?
Did you check the bathroom, the bathtub?
She sleeps there sometimes
Water cleanses, you know
Washes dirt away, makes new
Maybe she, maybe she, maybe she, maybe, maybe she swam away

"Crackerman"

Kickin' as I'm tryin' to sleep
I got the mud beaneath my shoes
Rubber band, rubberband
Gun in hand, gun in hand
I wanna use

Roamin', roamin', roam
Get away, gotta get away
And I think I think too much
I don't care, yeah and I don't care
Roamin', roamin', roam
Get away, gotta get away
And I think I think too much

Trippin' as I'm thinkin'
'Bout a boy, his name was Sue
He's a man, he's man
Crackerman, crackerman
He's a woman too

Roamin', roamin', roam
Get away, gotta get away
And I think I think too much
I don't care, yeah and I don't care
Roamin', roamin', roam

"Where The River Goes"

Yeah, I could hide in the calm of the eye of the storm
And never blow away
Well, I'm a young man with a knife to my back
Some things never seem to change

Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
Sing the song or keep it inside
Bought the farm, but the farmer done died
Sing that song, sing that song inside

I wish I could live in the dream
that I fly on the tarred & freathered wings
Well, I'm losing a game of reality
dice where the dealer never ever pays

Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
Sing the song or keep it inside
Bought the farm, but the farmer done died
Sing that song, sing that song inside

I wanna be as big as a mountain
I wanna fly as high as the sun
I wanna know what the rent's like in heaven
I wanna know where the river goes

Yeah, I could hide in the calm of the eye of the storm
And never blow away
Well, I'm a young man with a knife to my back
Some things never seen to change

Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
Sing the song or keep it inside
Bought the farm, but the farmer done died
Sing that song, sing that song inside

I wanna be as big as a mountain
I wanna fly as high as the sun
I wanna know what the rent's like in heaven
I wanna know where the river goes

If I was stronger
I could be a mountain range
If night was longer
Could I escape the day?
If I was stronger
I could be a mountain range
If night was longer
Could I escape the day?

Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
Sing the song or keep it inside
Bought the farm, but the farmer done died
Sing that song, sing that song inside

I wanna be as big as a mountain
I wanna fly as high as the sun
I wanna know what the rent's like in heaven
I wanna know where the river...
I wanna be as big as a mountain
I wanna fly as high as the sun
I wanna know what the rent's like in heaven
I wanna know where the river goes
Where the river goes
Where the river goes
Where the river, yeah
Where the river
Where the river
Where the river
Where the river
Where the river goes
Where the river goes
